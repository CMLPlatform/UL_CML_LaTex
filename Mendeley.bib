@article{Mentink2014,
	abstract = {The Master's programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology. Companies need new business models to grasp the opportunities of a circular economy. This thesis investigates to what extent existing frameworks, methods and tools for business model innovation are useful to cope with the challenges of designing and implementing circular business models. To innovate towards a circular business model, the use of a new framework and tool is recommended. The Circular Business Model Innovation framework outlines a process of 18 typical obstacles – or challenges – which should be taken into account. The Business Cycle Canvas supports practitioners to think in systems and develop supply chains with a closed material loop, one the most important challenges when designing a circular business model.},

@article{Schneider2010,
abstract = {This article reviews the burgeoning emerging literature on sustainable degrowth. This is defined as an equitable downscaling of production and consumption that increases human well-being and enhances ecological conditions at the local and global level, in the short and long term. The paradigmatic propositions of degrowth are that economic growth is not sustainable and that human progress without economic growth is possible. Degrowth proponents come from diverse origins. Some are critics of market globalization, new technologies or the imposition of western models of development in the rest of the world. All criticize GDP accounting though they propose often different social and ecological indicators. Degrowth theorists and practitioners support an extension of human relations instead of market relations, demand a deepening of democracy, defend ecosystems, and propose a more equal distribution of wealth. We distinguish between depression, i.e. unplanned degrowth within a growth regime, and sustainable degrowth, a voluntary, smooth and equitable transition to a regime of lower production and consumption. The question we ask is how positive would degrowth be if instead of being imposed by an economic crisis, it would actually be a democratic collective decision, a project with the ambition of getting closer to ecological sustainability and socio-environmental justice worldwide. Most articles in this issue were originally presented at the April 2008 conference in Paris on Economic Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity. This conference brought the word degrowth and the concepts around it into an international academic setting. Articles of this special issue are summarized in this introductory article. Hueting, d'Alessandro and colleagues, van den Bergh, Kerschner, Spangenberg and Alcott discuss whether current growth patterns are (un)sustainable and offer different perspectives on what degrowth might mean, and whether and under what conditions it might be desirable. Matthey and Hamilton focus on social dynamics and the obstacles and opportunities for voluntary social action towards degrowth. Lietaert and Cattaneo with Gavald?? offer a down-to-earth empirical discussion of two practical living experiments: cohousing and squats, highlighting the obstacles for scaling up such alternatives. Finally van Griethuysen explains why growth is an imperative in modern market economies, raising also the question whether degrowth is possible without radical institutional changes. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Since these tables provide detailed information about international production networks, they have recently attracted considerable attention in research on spatial economics, global value chains, and issues relating to trade in value added. The Institute of Developing Economies at the Japan External Trade Organization (IDE-JETRO) has more than 40 years of experience in the construction and analysis of international IO tables. This paper explains the development of IDE-JETRO's multi-regional IO projects including the construction of the Asian International Input?Output table and the Transnational Interregional Input?Output table between China and Japan.

abstract = {We propose a cellular automaton model of solid tumour growth, in which each cell is equipped with a micro-environment response network. This network is modelled using a feed-forward artificial neural network, that takes environmental variables as an input and from these determines the cellular behaviour as the output. The response of the network is determined by connection weights and thresholds in the network, which are subject to mutations when the cells divide. As both available space and nutrients are limited resources for the tumour, this gives rise to clonal evolution where only the fittest cells survive. Using this approach we have investigated the impact of the tissue oxygen concentration on the growth and evolutionary dynamics of the tumour. The results show that the oxygen concentration affects the selection pressure, cell population diversity and morphology of the tumour. A low oxygen concentration in the tissue gives rise to a tumour with a fingered morphology that contains aggressive phenotypes with a small apoptotic potential, while a high oxygen concentration in the tissue gives rise to a tumour with a round morphology containing less evolved phenotypes. The tissue oxygen concentration thus affects the tumour at both the morphological level and on the phenotype level.},

@article{EllenMacArthurFoundation2015,
abstract = {The circular economy is gaining increasing attention in Europe and around the world as a potential way for our society to increase prosperity, while reducing dependence on primary materials and energy. The European Commission is expected to propose a “circular economy package” by the end of 2015, and many business leaders embrace the circular economy as a path to increasing growth and profitability. At the same time, a lively debate is going on about the attractiveness of a circular economy for different stakeholders and its implications for employment, growth, and the environment. This report aims to contribute to a fact base to inform this debate, especially in Europe. The report suggests what a circular European economy could look like and compares its potential impact with the current development path. The report models potential European economic and environmental outcomes in both scenarios. It also examines how a more circular way of satisfying human needs could play out in three of the largest and most resource-intensive European value chains: mobility, food, and the built environment. In aggregate, the circular scenarios suggest that the opportunity for Europe's economy could be large. The report does not aim to provide final answers or projections for a circular economy—this would be impossible given the major uncertainties involved in the transition. Rather, the report tries to identify and describe major differences that circularity could bring to the European economy and offers directional quantification of the most important differences. In doing so, the report builds on previous circular economy research, including work by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the McKinsey Center for Business and Environment. This report is the product of a knowledge partnership between the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Stiftungsfonds f{\"{u}}r Umwelt{\"{o}}konomie und Nachhaltigkeit (SUN),the new environmental economics branch of the Deutsche Post Foundation, and the McKinsey Center for Business and Environment. We encourage policy-makers inspired by the vision presented in this report to read the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's new and complementary report, Delivering the circular economy: A toolkit for policy-makers. The toolkit offers an actionable, step-by-step methodology to help transition towards a circular economy. We are grateful to our numerous partners and advisors for their insights and support throughout this project, as acknowledged in the pages that follow. This report has truly been a collaborative effort by business, policy-makers, and academia. We hope you find this report informative and useful. We invite you to engage with us on this timely opportunity.},

During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, many aspects of western European society changed fundamentally, including the abolition of common-property rights, which in itself was related to social and economic shifts in that same society. This book intends to put the debate on commons, commoners, and the disappearance of both throughout early modern and modern northwestern Europe in a new light, through new approaches and innovative methodologies. Tine De Moor aims to link the historical debate about the long-term evolution of commons to the present-day debates on common-pool resources, as well as touching upon various disciplines within the social sciences that work on commons issues.},

To solve this problem, we propose in this paper a two-stage SUBE approach, which takes as prior the initially estimated SUBE multipliers and obtains a posterior set of two-stage SUBE multipliers by constrained least squares minimization. We illustrate the results with an empirical application for carbon emissions in the Portuguese economy in 2005. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Yet despite growing recognition of this imperative, the problem of air pollution is far from solved in many countries, and the global health impacts risk intensifying in the decades to come. The scale of the public health crisis caused by air pollution and the importance of the energy sector to its resolution are the reasons why the IEA is focusing on this critical topic for the first time. Based on new data for pollutant emissions in 2015 and projections to 2040, this special report, the latest in the World Energy Outlook series, provides a global outlook for energy and air pollution as well as detailed profiles of key countries and regions: the United States, Mexico, the European Union, China, India, Southeast Asia and Africa. In a Clean Air Scenario, the report proposes a pragmatic and attainable strategy to reconcile the world's energy requirements with its need for cleaner air. Alongside the multiple benefits to human health, this strategy shows that resolving the world's air pollution problem can go hand-in-hand with progress towards other environmental and development goals.},

abstract = {Bringing about more sustainable consumption patterns is an important challenge for society and science. In this article the concept of household metabolism is applied to analyzing consumption patterns and to identifying possibilities for the development of sustainable household consumption patterns. Household metabolism is determined in terms of total energy requirements, including both direct and indirect energy requirements, using a hybrid method. This method enables us to evaluate various determinants of the environmental load of consumption consistently at several levels—the national level, the local level, and the household level. The average annual energy requirement of households varies considerably between the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Sweden, as well as within these countries. The average expenditure level per household explains a large part of the observed variations. Differences between these countries are also related to the efficiency of the production sectors and to the energy supply system. The consumption categories of food, transport, and recreation show the largest contributions to the environmental load. A comparison of consumer groups with different household characteristics shows remarkable differences in the division of spending over the consumption categories. Thus, analyses of different types of households are important for providing a basis for options to induce decreases of the environmental load of household consumption. At the city level, options for change are provided by an analysis of the city infrastructure, which determines a large part of the direct energy use by households (for transport and heating). At the national level, energy efficiency in production and in electricity generation is an important trigger for decreasing household energy requirements.},

abstract = {This paper identifies a fundamental challenge in the development of input-output databases of the world economy intended for analysis of alternative scenarios with a model of the world economy. Primary data sources for individual economies generally do not use the same sectoral classification schemes, in part for lack of coordination and also because not all economies produce all goods. In addition, some economies produce a given good simultaneously using several technologies, sometimes quite distinct in terms of factor requirements and cost structures, information that can and should be retained for scenario analysis. To accommodate the relevant information in a way that is both precise and parsimonious, we introduce rectangular input-output matrices and a modeling framework for analyzing them. This framework extends an existing input-output/linear programming model, the rectangular choice-of-technology (RCOT) model, and integrates it into an existing input-output/linear programming model of the world economy, the World Trade Model (WTM). The desirable properties of the resulting WTM/RCOT model are illustrated through a numerical example. This formulation requires that a criterion be specified to choose among available options, and we discuss some alternative criteria. Square input-output matrices and their inverses are only a special case of this more general formulation, and we show how moving to the rectangular formulation expands the types of questions that input-output analysts are able to address.JEL Classification: C67, C61, F14, O33.},

@article{Zerriffi2011a,
abstract = {For those in developed nations, suddenly being without electricity is a disaster: power cuts have us fretting over the food stored in the freezer, and even a few hours without lights, televisions, or air conditioning is an ordeal. However, for an estimated 1.6 billion people worldwide, the absence of electricity is their daily experience. An untold number of others live with electricity that is erratic and of poor quality. How can electric power be brought into their lives when the centralized utility models that have evolved in developed nations are not an economically viable option? Poor, rural communities in developing nations cannot simply be 'plugged in' to a grid.Small-scale Distributed Generation (DG), ranging from individual solar home systems to village level grids run off diesel generators, could provide the answer, and this book compares around 20 DG enterprises and projects in Brazil, Cambodia and China, each of which is considered to be a "business model" for distributed rural electrification. While large, centralized power projects often rely on big subsidies, this study shows that privately run and localized solutions can be both self-sustaining and replicable. Its three sections provide a general introduction to the issue of electrification and rural development, set out the details of the case studies and compare the models involved, and discuss the important thematic issues of equity, access to capital and cost-recovery.Hisham Zerriffi shows that in each case, it is not simply a matter of matching a particular technology to a particular need. Numerous institutional factors come into play including the regulatory regime, access to financial services, and government/utility support or opposition to the DG alternative. Despite this, in many countries, the question is not whether DG has a role to play. Rather it is a question of how it will play a role.},

abstract = {A recent paper in which embodied land appropriation of exports was calculated using a physical input-output model (Ecological Economics 44 (2003) 137-151) initiated a discussion in this journal concerning the conceptual differences between input-output models using a coefficient matrix based on physical input-output tables (PIOTs) in a single unit of mass and input-output models using a coefficient matrix based on monetary input-output tables (MIOTs) extended by a coefficient vector of physical factor inputs per unit of output. In this contribution we argue that the conceptual core of the discrepancies found when comparing outcomes obtained using physical vs. monetary input-output models lies in the assumptions regarding unit prices and not in the treatment of waste as has been claimed (Ecological Economics 48 (2004) 9-17). We first show that a basic static input-output model with the coefficient matrix derived from a monetary input-output table is equivalent to one where the coefficient matrix is derived from an input-output table in physical units provided that the assumption of unique sectoral prices is satisfied. We then illustrate that the input-output tables that were used in the original publication do not satisfy the assumption of homogenous sectoral prices, even after the inconsistent treatment of waste in the PIOT is corrected. We show that substantially different results from the physical and the monetary models in fact remain. Finally, we identify and discuss possible reasons for the observed differences in sectoral prices faced by different purchasing sectors and draw conclusions for the future development of applied physical input-output analysis. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Analysts carrying out input-output analyses of environmental issues are often plagued by environmental and input-output data existing in different classifications, with environmentally sensitive sectors sometimes being aggregated in the economic input-output database. In principle there are two alternatives for dealing with such misalignment: either environmental data have to be aggregated into the input-output classification, which entails an undesirable loss of information, or input-output data have to be disaggregated based on fragmentary information. In this article, I show that disaggregation of input-output data, even if based on few real data points, is superior to aggregating environmental data in determining input-output multipliers. This is especially true if the disaggregated sectors are heterogeneous with respect to their economic and environmental characteristics. The results of this work may help analysts in understanding that disaggregation based on even a small amount of proxy information can improve the accuracy of input-output multipliers significantly. Perhaps, these results will also provide encouragement for preferring model isaggregation to aggregation in future work. {\textcopyright} 2011 The International Input-Output Association.},

@article{Ferng2009,
abstract = {Application of input-output analysis to ecological footprints (EFs) is shifting from an ex-post static calculation toward an ex-ante scenario analysis for enhancing the policy relevance of EF analysis. This change in application prompts two issues requiring careful examination: (1) what is measured by Leontief inverses or extended environmental Leontief inverses, and (2) whether a sector's land multiplier (or compositions of land multiplier) can appropriately reflect the effect of delivering one unit of the sector's output to final demand on the required area(s) of production lands used by the sector itself and by other producing sectors whose products are contributed directly and indirectly to its production. The underlying message of these two questions is whether the assumed linear marginal relationship between a sector's output and its intermediate inputs (input-output coefficients)-a critical assumption made by W. Leontief to transform a transactions table from an accounting framework into the input-output model-can be extended to assume that the marginal relationship between a sector's output and the area of production land it uses for generating output is fixed (land-output marginal coefficient equal to average coefficient). By reviewing the literature on input-output analysis and its application to environmental issues and by theoretically and empirically examining the relation between sector output and land appropriation, this study advises against the use of land multipliers or their compositions in the EF scenario analysis. To apply the input-output model to EF scenario analysis for enhancing policy relevance with due attention to the relationship between sector output and land appropriation, this study suggests a two-stage EF calculation procedure. In the first stage, the input-output application estimates only the required raw materials (or generated pollutants) for meeting a given consumption pattern, which is the objective of environmental input-output analysis; in the second stage, the estimated amount of raw materials or pollutants is converted into land/water area, and a choice of conversion methods is suggested according to the research questions and the availability of conversion methods and required data. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@techreport{EllenMacArthurFoundation2013,
abstract = {In January 2012, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation launched a report on the business and economic rationale for a circular economy. Given the complexity of the topic, it offered an introduction to an alternative to the linear ‘take – make – dispose' model of consumption. The report showed that this linear model is facing competition from a pattern of resource deployment that is circular by design: it creates much more value from each unit of resource by recovering and regenerating products and materials at the end of each service life. More specifically, it demonstrated that designing and using durable goods, such as cars and vans, washing machines, and mobile telephones, in accordance with circular principles offers materials savings in Europe that could be worth USD 380 billion in an initial transition period and up to USD 630 billion with full adoption. This year, the Foundation has turned its focus to ‘fast-moving' consumer goods, products that typically have a lower unit cost, are bought more often, and have a much shorter service life than durable goods. Fast-moving consumer goods currently account for 35 per cent of material inputs into the economy, a significant part of total consumer spending on tangible goods, and 75 per cent of municipal waste. Importantly, the consumer goods sector absorbs more than 90 per cent of our agricultural output—possibly our most embattled resource in the future. If we are to move to a circular economy, it is therefore crucial to test how it applies to the consumer goods sector.},

abstract = {Switching from the current linear model of economy to a circular one has recently attracted increased attention from major global companies e.g., Google, Unilever, Renault, and policymakers attending the World Economic Forum. The reasons for this are the huge financial, social and environmental benefits. However, the global shift from one model of economy to another also concerns smaller companies on a micro-level. Thus, comprehensive knowledge on designing circular business models is needed to stimulate and foster implementation of the circular economy. Existing business models for the circular economy have limited transferability and there is no comprehensive framework supporting every kind of company in designing a circular business model. This study employs a literature review to identify and classify the circular economy characteristics according to a business model structure. The investigation in the eight sub-domains of research on circular business models was used to redefine the components of the business model canvas in the context of the circular economy. Two new components—the take-back system and adoption factors—have been identified, thereby leading to the conceptualization of an extended framework for the circular business model canvas. Additionally, the triple fit challenge has been recognized as an enabler of the transition towards a circular business model. Some directions for further research have been outlined, as well.},

abstract = {The concept of circular economy (CE) is to an increasing extent treated as a solution to series of challenges such as waste generation, resource scarcity and sustaining economic benefits. However the concept of circularity is not of novel as such. Specific circumstances and motivations have stimulated ideas relevant to circularity in the past through activities such as reuse, remanufacturing or recycling. Main objectives of this work are: to provide a comprehensive review of research efforts encompassing aspects of resources scarcity, waste generation and economic advantages; to explore the CE landscape in the context of these three aspects especially when they are considered simultaneously; based on an idea of a comprehensive CE framework, propose an implementation strategy using top-down and bottom-up approach in a concurrent manner. To fulfill this objective a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art research is carried out to understand different ideas relevant to CE, motivation for the research and context of their recurrence. Main contributions of this paper are a comprehensive CE framework and a practical implementation strategy for a regenerative economy and natural environment. The framework emphasizes on a combined view of three main aspects i.e. environment, resources and economic benefits. It also underlines that joint support of all stakeholders is necessary in order to successfully implement the CE concept at large scale. The proposed framework and implementation strategy also identify new avenues for future research and practice in the field of CE.},

abstract = {In 1972, three scientists from MIT created a computer model that analyzed global resource consumption and production. Their results shocked the world and created stirring conversation about global 'overshoot,' or resource use beyond the carrying capacity of the planet. Now, preeminent environmental scientists Donnella Meadows, Jorgen Randers, and Dennis Meadows have teamed up again to update and expand their original findings in The Limits to Growth: The 30 Year Update. Meadows, Randers, and Meadows are international environmental leaders recognized for their groundbreaking research into early signs of wear on the planet. Citing climate change as the most tangible example of our current overshoot, the scientists now provide us with an updated scenario and a plan to reduce our needs to meet the carrying capacity of the planet. Over the past three decades, population growth and global warming have forged on with a striking semblance to the scenarios laid out by the World3 computer model in the original Limits to Growth. While Meadows, Randers, and Meadows do not make a practice of predicting future environmental degradation, they offer an analysis of present and future trends in resource use, and assess a variety of possible outcomes. In many ways, the message contained in Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update is a warning. Overshoot cannot be sustained without collapse. But, as the authors are careful to point out, there is reason to believe that humanity can still reverse some of its damage to Earth if it takes appropriate measures to reduce inefficiency and waste. Written in refreshingly accessible prose, Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update is a long anticipated revival of some of the original voices in the growing chorus of sustainability. Limits to Growth: The 30 Year Update is a work of stunning intelligence that will expose for humanity the hazy but critical line between human growth and human development.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate the influence of fugitive methane emissions from coal, natural gas, and shale gas extraction on the greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts of fossil fuel power generation through its life cycle. A multiregional hybridized life cycle assessment (LCA) model is used to evaluate several electricity generation technologies with and without carbon dioxide capture and storage. Based on data from the UNFCCC and other literature sources, it is shown that methane emissions from fossil fuel production vary more widely than commonly acknowledged in the LCA literature. This high variability, together with regional disparity in methane emissions, points to the existence of both significant uncertainty and natural variability. The results indicate that the impact of fugitive methane emissions can be significant, ranging from 3{\%} to 56{\%} of total impacts depending on type of technology and region. Total GHG emissions, in CO2-eq./kWh, vary considerably according to the region of the power plant, plant type, and the choice of associated fugitive methane emissions, with values as low as 0.08kg CO2-eq./kWh and as high as 1.52kg CO2-eq./kWh. The variability indicates significant opportunities for controlling methane emissions from fuel chains.},

abstract = {End-of-life electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) has recently received attention as a secondary source of metals. This study examined characteristics of end-of-life EEE as secondary metal resources to consider efficient collection and metal recovery systems according to the specific metals and types of EEE. We constructed an analogy between natural resource development and metal recovery from end-of-life EEE and found that metal content and total annual amount of metal contained in each type of end-of-life EEE should be considered in secondary resource development, as well as the collectability of the end-of-life products. We then categorized 21 EEE types into five groups and discussed their potential as secondary metal resources. Refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners, and CRT TVs were evaluated as the most important sources of common metals, and personal computers, mobile phones, and video games were evaluated as the most important sources of precious metals. Several types of small digital equipment were also identified as important sources of precious metals; however, mid-size information and communication technology (ICT) equipment (e.g., printers and fax machines) and audio/video equipment were shown to be more important as a source of a variety of less common metals. The physical collectability of each type of EEE was roughly characterized by unit size and number of end-of-life products generated annually. Current collection systems in Japan were examined and potentially appropriate collection methods were suggested for equipment types that currently have no specific collection systems in Japan, particularly for video games, notebook computers, and mid-size ICT and audio/video equipment. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions caused by human actions is probably one of the major global environmental problems that we face today.$\backslash$nIn order to reduce the risk of climate change and the potential effects thereof,$\backslash$nthe emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane$\backslash$n(CH4 ) should be reduced.$\backslash$nMuch greenhouse gases are emitted due to the combustion of fossil fuels. At$\backslash$npresent, these fuels fulfil about 60{\%} of our global energy needs. Therefore, a$\backslash$nmore efficient use of fossil energy is generally viewed as an important option to$\backslash$nreduce the emissions of greenhouse gases.$\backslash$nA large part of global fossil energy use (about 40{\%}) is consumed in the$\backslash$nindustrial sector to manufacture materials and products. Not surprisingly,$\backslash$nseveral studies show that options that lead to more efficient use of materials$\backslash$noften lead to reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, in current greenhouse$\backslash$ngas emission reduction policies, not much attention is paid to more efficient$\backslash$nmaterial management as an option to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.$\backslash$nIn the introductory chapter, several studies are briefly discussed that focus on$\backslash$nthe material use of economies over time. The general conclusion of these$\backslash$nstudies is that for materials the consumption per unit GDP has decreased over$\backslash$nthe last decades, but that the total consumption of these materials is still$\backslash$ngrowing due to economic growth.$\backslash$nIn this thesis the focus is on improved material management options that lead$\backslash$nto greenhouse gas emission reduction. It aims to contribute to the following$\backslash$nquestion: Which greenhouse gas emission reduction can be achieved$\backslash$npotentially, by improved management of materials?$\backslash$nThe scope is limited in the number of product groups that are studied, the$\backslash$nnumber of greenhouse gases studied and the geographical area. The question$\backslash$nthat is addressed in this thesis is therefore:$\backslash$nWhich greenhouse gas emission reduction, especially CO2 , can be achieved$\backslash$npotentially in Western Europe or The Netherlands, by improved management of$\backslash$nmaterials in the product groups 'packaging', 'residential buildings', and$\backslash$n'publication paper'??194$\backslash$n8.2 Summary of individual case studies (Chapters 2 7)$\backslash$nTo answer this question, a technology-oriented approach is used. Technologies$\backslash$nand measures are analyzed that are available or are expected to come$\backslash$navailable in the near future (10-20 years). For each measure that might lead to$\backslash$nan improved use of materials, the potential reduction in greenhouse gases is$\backslash$ndetermined. For a significant part of the investigated measures, the costs of the$\backslash$nmeasures are calculated. To assess the technical or techno-economic potential$\backslash$nof improved material management, the cumulative effect of the measures is$\backslash$ndetermined and corrected for inter-measure influences. Even though technical$\backslash$nand techno-economic potentials provide valuable information, they do not give$\backslash$nany information about actual market potential of these measures. The reason$\backslash$nfor this is that all kind of barriers may prevent measures from being$\backslash$nimplemented, e.g., knowledge deficits, the need for large organizational efforts$\backslash$nor changes, uncertainties about market acceptation of changed products, as$\backslash$nwell as inexperience with new technologies. In several chapters in this thesis,$\backslash$nfirst steps are taken to incorporate information about expected implementation$\backslash$ndifficulties in the technical and techno-economic assessments.$\backslash$nIn this thesis, it is not possible to assess the potential of efficient material$\backslash$nmanagement measures for all materials. Therefore, the focus is on three$\backslash$nproduct groups that are important from a material use and greenhouse gas$\backslash$nemission point of view: packaging, communication papers, and residential$\backslash$nbuildings. Packaging is an important product groups since 40{\%} of the$\backslash$nmunicipal solid waste in Western Europe consists of packaging. Furthermore,$\backslash$nthe production of packaging materials leads to an annual emission of about$\backslash$n105 Mtonne CO2, or 3{\%} of Western Europes anthropogenic greenhouse gas$\backslash$nemissions. Residential buildings is an important product group since it$\backslash$nrepresents the construction sector. This sector consumes about half of the total$\backslash$namount of materials in Western Europe. The product group publication papers$\backslash$nis important since it is the largest consumer of paper and the production of$\backslash$nthese papers requires about 40 Mtonnes of CO2.$\backslash$nIn all three product-groups, renewable materials like paper and wood play an$\backslash$nimportant role.$\backslash$n- Paper and wood are used in large quantities for packaging purposes. In the$\backslash$nWestern European packaging flows analyzed in this thesis, 20 Mtonnes$\backslash$npaper and wood are used for packaging purposes on a total packaging$\backslash$nconsumption of about 50 Mtonnes in Western Europe (see Chapters 3, 4$\backslash$nand 5).$\backslash$n- The product group communication papers is an important use category of$\backslash$npaper, while large technical challenges may lay ahead in this market$\backslash$nsegment that may affect paper use (see Chapter 6).$\backslash$n- For the residential building sector, wood is seen as a material with large$\backslash$npotentials to reduce energy use and GHG emissions associated with$\backslash$nmaterials manufacturing (see Chapter 7).?Chapter 8$\backslash$n195$\backslash$nThe first step in analyzing the potential improved in material management is to$\backslash$ncreate insights in the size of material flows through our economy. For many$\backslash$nmaterials (inter)national statistics are available on production, consumption$\backslash$nand foreign trade. These data should be used with care since they present$\backslash$ninformation about the apparent consumption of materials. This is the$\backslash$nproduction of materials by a country plus imports minus exports. The imports$\backslash$nand exports of goods and services that contain the materials are not$\backslash$nincorporated in these statistics. Consequently, the apparent consumption data$\backslash$nare not always equal to the real consumption of materials in a country, also$\backslash$ncalled: final consumption.$\backslash$nIn Chapter 2, a contribution is made to the development of a methodology to$\backslash$ncreate insights in the final consumption of materials, focused on The$\backslash$nNetherlands. The method is based on data available from the so-called supply$\backslash$nand use tables; these tables are made available by Statistics Netherlands and$\backslash$ndescribe the economy of a country in terms of annual supply and use of goods$\backslash$nand services by industries and consumers. The method provides detailed$\backslash$ninformation on flows that are normally not visible in statistics: indirect flows like$\backslash$npackaging materials and product parts. These indirect flows are normally not$\backslash$nvisible since they are part of other products and not discerned in regular$\backslash$nstatistics.$\backslash$nThe original method, developed by Joosten et al. (1999), was tested and$\backslash$nimproved. The improved method resulted in an improvement of the estimates$\backslash$nof physical flow quantities based on monetary data and in an improvement of$\backslash$nthe indirect flow estimates.$\backslash$nThe analysis focused on two material flows, i.e. paper and wood. For the paper$\backslash$nflows in the Netherlands, insights in the amount of paper that leaves and enters$\backslash$nthe Dutch economy in the shape of packaging leads to a correction of the$\backslash$npaper recovery data as currently used in international statistics. In Chapter 2, a$\backslash$nfinal consumption of 237 kg paper per capita is calculated for the Netherlands$\backslash$nwhile international statistics present an apparent consumption of 204 kg per$\backslash$ncapita for the same year (1990). Where international statistics calculate a$\backslash$nrecovery rate of 51{\%} for the Netherlands (i.e. the amount of waste paper$\backslash$nrecovered as share of the total paper consumption) based on apparent$\backslash$nconsumption data, our analysis shows that the recovery rate is more likely to be$\backslash$n45{\%} based on final consumption data. The improved method proves to be very$\backslash$nuseful in analyzing the final consumption of paper and wood in The$\backslash$nNetherlands.$\backslash$nChapter 3 focuses on the potential reduction in CO2 emissions and cost-efficiency$\backslash$nof material efficiency improvement in the product group packaging.$\backslash$nMore specifically, Chapter 3 focuses on primary packaging. This is all$\backslash$npackaging that is in direct contact with the packed product. Consequently, it$\backslash$nexcludes transport packaging that is used to protect the products and primary$\backslash$npackaging during transport. The CO2 emissions related to primary packaging$\backslash$naccount for about 3{\%} of Western Europe's CO2 emissions. In our analysis$\backslash$nmeasures for improved use of primary packaging material are identified and?196$\backslash$nevaluated. The potential and cost of each measure is determined. A supply$\backslash$ncurve for CO2 emission reduction is presented based on data on the use of$\backslash$nprimary packaging in 1995. We show that, technically, it appears possible to$\backslash$nreduce the CO2 emissions related to the production and use of primary$\backslash$npackaging in 1995 by 51{\%} (= 40 Mtonne CO2) by implementing new$\backslash$npackaging technology that is expected to become available between 1995 and$\backslash$n2010. In our analysis, options like improvement of energy efficiency in material$\backslash$nproduction processes and changes in packaging demand are not taken into$\backslash$naccount. All evaluated measures can be implemented cost-effectively when$\backslash$nconsidering life-cycle costs. Evaluation of the improvement measures shows$\backslash$nthat 9{\%} reduction of CO2 emissions related to primary packaging is feasible by$\backslash$nusing lighter packages. Material substitution can lead to a reduction of 10{\%}.$\backslash$nFrom a CO2 emission reduction point of view, the most promising improvement$\backslash$nis substitution of single use packaging by re-usable packaging. This may lead$\backslash$nto 32{\%} reduction in CO2 emissions. However, large scale implementation of$\backslash$nthis option in Western Europe may be very complex, because of needed$\backslash$nchanges in the current infrastructural organization.$\backslash$nChapter 4 focuses on transport packaging in Western Europe. Like in Chapter$\backslash$n3, measures for improved use of packaging material are identified and$\backslash$nevaluated. For transport packaging in Western Europe 12 Mtonne corrugated$\backslash$nboard is used, 5 Mtonne wood and 3.5 Mtonne plastics. The production and$\backslash$nconsumption of these materials lea},

abstract = {Micro-Grid is a small system consisting of micro-power source and the load, which provide electricity and heat for the user. Micro-grid concept proposed mainly to solve large-scale, distributed power and network diversity technically and issues on the market and policy in order to play the advantages of distributed generation technologies in the economic, energy and the environment. It can maximize acceptance of distributed power, and better meet the electricity users' requirements of power reliability and power quality. Therefore, the research and development of micro-network is an inevitable choice for a large number of distributed generation connected to the grid. This paper briefly discusses evolution of Micro-Grid development, including the difference from conventional power system, the characteristics of Micro-Grid, the present research status, and the key technologies of Smart Grid. {\textcopyright} (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Acinetobacter baumannii contains RND-family efflux systems AdeABC and AdeIJK, which pump out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds, as judged from the MIC changes occurring upon deletion of the responsible genes. However, these studies may miss changes because of the high backgrounds generated by the remaining pumps and by $\beta$-lactamases, and it is unclear how the activities of these pumps compare quantitatively with those of the well-studied AcrAB-TolC system of Escherichia coli. We expressed adeABC and adeIJK of A. baumannii, as well as E. coli acrAB, in an E. coli host from which acrAB was deleted. The A. baumannii pumps were functional in E. coli, and the MIC changes that were observed largely confirmed the substrate range already reported, with important differences. Thus, the AdeABC system pumped out all $\beta$-lactams, an activity that was often missed in deletion studies. When the expression level of the pump genes was adjusted to a similar level for a comparison with AcrAB-TolC, we found that both A. baumannii efflux systems pumped out a wide range of compounds, but AdeABC was less effective than AcrAB-TolC in the extrusion of lipophilic $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was more effective at tetracycline efflux. AdeIJK was remarkably more effective than a similar level of AcrAB-TolC in the efflux of $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was less so in the efflux of erythromycin. These results thus allow us to compare these efflux systems on a quantitative basis, if we can assume that the heterologous systems are fully functional in the E. coli host.},

abstract = {Many sociologists incorrectly believe that larger groups are less likely to support collective action than smaller ones. The effect of group size, in fact, depends on costs. If the costs of collective goods rise with the number who share in them, larger groups act less frequently than smaller ones. If the costs vary little with group size, larger groups should exhibit more collective action than smaller ones because larger groups have more resources and are more likely to have a critical mass of highly interested and resourceful actors. The positive effects of group size increase with group heterogeneity and nonrandom social ties. Paradoxically, when groups are hetero- geneous, fewer contributors may be needed to provide a good to larger groups, making collective action less complex and less expensive. Empirical},

Although the CPR design principles are increasingly seen as the ingredients for successful collective action, it is naTve to expect that 'success' will be achieved once they are implemented.

When parked, the fuel cell in the car can produce electricity from hydrogen, which is cleaner and more efficient than the current electricity system, generating useful ‘waste' products in the form of heat and fresh water. The produced electricity, heat and fresh water can be fed into the respective grids or be used directly in our house, office or the school of our kids. The required hydrogen can be produced from gas (natural gas, biogas) or electricity (hydro, wind, solar, etc.). In the end, these fuel cell cars can replace all power plants worldwide. As a result, the ‘car as power plant' can create an integrated, efficient, reliable, flexible, clean, smart and personalized transport, energy and water system: a real paradigm shift.The ‘Car as Power Plant' is developed at Delft Technical University, in The Green Village: a sustainable, lively and entrepreneurial environment where we discover, learn and show how to solve society's urgent challenges.

The behaviour of these systems is determined by many actors, situated in a dynamic, multi-actor, multi-objective and multi-level environment. How can such systems be modelled and how can the socio-technical complexity be captured? Agent-based modelling is a proven approach to handle this challenge. This book provides a practical introduction to agent-based modelling of socio-technical systems, based on a methodology that has been developed at TU Delft and which has been deployed in a large number of case studies. The book consists of two parts: the first presents the background, theory and methodology as well as practical guidelines and procedures for building models. In the second part this theory is applied to a number of case studies, where for each model the development steps are presented extensively, preparing the reader for creating own models.},

abstract = {For most materials used to provide buildings, infrastructure, equipment and products, global stocks are still sufficient to meet anticipated demand, but the environmental impacts of materials production and processing, particularly those related to energy, are rapidly becoming critical. These impacts can be ameliorated to some extent by the ongoing pursuit of efficiencies within existing processes, but demand is anticipated to double in the next 40 years, and this will lead to an unacceptable increase in overall impacts unless the total requirement for material production and processing is reduced. This is the goal of material efficiency, and this paper aims to stimulate interest in the area. Four major strategies for reducing material demand through material efficiency are discussed: longer-lasting products; modularisation and remanufacturing; component re-use; designing products with less material. In industrialised nations, these strategies have had little attention, because of economic, regulatory and social barriers, which are each examined. However, evidence from waste management and the pursuit of energy efficiency suggests that these barriers might be overcome, and an outline of potential mechanisms for change is given. In bringing together insights into material efficiency from a wide range of disciplines, the paper presents a set of 20 open questions for future work. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Hinkel2015,
abstract = {The framework for analyzing sustainability of social-ecological systems (SES) framework of Elinor Ostrom is a multitier collection of concepts and variables that have proven to be relevant for understanding outcomes in diverse SES. The first tier of this framework includes the concepts resource system (RS) and resource units (RU), which are then further characterized through lower tier variables such as clarity of system boundaries and mobility. The long-term goal of framework development is to derive conclusions about which combinations of variables explain outcomes across diverse types of SES. This will only be possible if the concepts and variables of the framework can be made operational unambiguously for the different types of SES, which, however, remains a challenge. Reasons for this are that case studies examine other types of RS than those for which the framework has been developed or consider RS for which different actors obtain different kinds of RU. We explore these difficulties and relate them to antecedent work on common-pool resources and public goods. We propose a diagnostic procedure which resolves some of these difficulties by establishing a sequence of questions that facilitate the step-wise and unambiguous application of the SES framework to a given case. The questions relate to the actors benefiting from the SES, the collective goods involved in the generation of those benefits, and the action situations in which the collective goods are provided and appropriated. We illustrate the diagnostic procedure for four case studies in the context of irrigated agriculture in New Mexico, common property meadows in the Swiss Alps, recreational fishery in Germany, and energy regions in Austria. We conclude that the current SES framework has limitations when applied to complex, multiuse SES, because it does not sufficiently capture the actor interdependencies introduced through RS and RU characteristics and dynamics.},

However, apart from an occasional reference to socioeconomic status, the literature on the doctor-patient relationship has not addressed the influence of cultural difference between physicians and patients on communication effectiveness. Additionally, appropri-ate care of ethnically and racially diverse populations requires the ability to communicate with individuals who have limited English proficiency.

abstract = {The environmental benefits of renewable energy are well known. But the contribution that they can make to energy security is less widely recognised. This report aims to redress the balance, showing how in electricity generation, heat supply, and transport, renewables can enhance energy security and suggesting policies that can optimise this contribution. For those countries where growing dependence on imported gas is a significant energy security issue, renewables can provide alternative, and usually indigenous, sources of electric power as well as displacing electricity demand through direct heat production. Renewables also, usually, increase the diversity of electricity sources, and through local generation, contribute to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks. This makes it all the more important to pursue policies for research, development and deployment (RD{\&}D) that can progressively reduce the costs of renewables so that, with appropriate credit for carbon saving, they can be established as technologies of choice. Attention has focused disproportionately on the issue of the variability of renewable electricity production. This only applies to certain renewables, mainly wind and solar photovoltaics, and its significance depends on a range of factors - the penetration of the renewables concerned, the balance of plant on the system, the wider connectivity of the system, and the flexibility of the demand side. Variability will rarely be a bar to increased renewables deployment. But at high levels of penetration it requires careful analysis and management, and any additional costs that may be required for back-up or system modification must be taken into account.},

abstract = {Explores ways that the tragedy of the commons can be avoided by people who use common-property resources. While the tragedy of the commons is real, there are many instances where institutions develop to protect against overexploitation. In this important work, the authors explore empirically, theoretically, and experimentally the nature of such institutions and the way they come about. Forests, irrigation systems, fisheries, groundwater basins, grazing lands, and the air we breathe are all examples of common-pool resources (CPRs). Because no one has property rights or control over such a resource, users of CPRs are frequently assumed to be caught in an inescapable dilemma---overexploitation of the resource, or what is commonly known as "the tragedy of the commons." Many well-documented examples of overexploitation exist. The users of commonly held resources have, however, in many instances overcome incentives to destroy the resources and have developed long-enduring institutions---rule-in-use---that enabled them to utilize these resources more effectively. Understanding the conditions under which users of CPRs successfully develop and maintain effective institutions is critical to facilitating improved resource policies. Using the analytic tools of game theory and institutional analysis and an empirical foundation based on controlled laboratory experiments and field data, this book explores endogenous institutional development. Specifically, this research focuses on three questions. In CPR dilemmas, to what degree are the predictions about behavior and outcomes derived from noncooperative game theory supported by empirical evidence? Where behavior and outcomes are substantially different from the predicted, are there behavioral regularities that can be drawn upon in the development of improved theories? What types of institutional and physical variables affect the likelihood of successful resolution of CPR dilemmas? This is a work of important relevance to all studying environmental issues from a wide variety of disciplinary perspectives.},

abstract = {Ecological resilience, adaptive cycles, and panarchy are all concepts that have been developed to explain abrupt and often surprising changes in complex socio-ecological systems that are prone to disturbances. These types of changes involve qualitative and quantitative alterations in systems' structures and processes. This paper uses the concepts of ecological resilience, adaptive cycles, and panarchies to compare ecological and human community systems. At least five important findings emerge from this comparison. 1) Both systems demonstrate the multiple meanings of resilience-both in terms of recovery time from disturbances and the capacity to absorb them. 2) Both systems recognize the role of diversity in contributing to resilience. 3) The comparison highlights the role of different forms of capital and 4) the importance of cross-scale interactions. 5) The comparison reveals the need for experimentation and learning to build adaptive capacities. All of these ideas have broad implications for attempting to manage complex systems with human and ecological components in the face of recurring natural disasters. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the author(s).},

Mollusc dive fisheries, with more than 10 000 professional registered divers, represent about 70{\%} of total invertebrate landings. The fishery for the gastropod (Concholepas concholepas), the loco, was closed between 1989 and 1992. The closure was lifted twice in 1993, for a total of 14 days, under new management regulations institutionalized in the 1991 Chilean Fishery and Aquaculture Law (No. 18,892). The loco fishery landed 8574 t in 1993, with an export value of US{\$}64 million. Existing regulations to control both dive fishery effort and access to fishing grounds are described. Fishery monitoring was conducted during the 1993 loco fishing seasons in 4 Caletas (small-scale fisher associations, each centered around a cove) in central Chile. Annual closures of small coastal MEAs (management and exploitation areas) resulted in larger CPUE (catch per unit effort) and reduced travel time. Larger size loco receiving higher prices resulted. Future co-management options to better achieve sustainable exploitation of Chilean benthic invertebrates are discussed.},

abstract = {Spatial distribution of fishing effort is increasingly recognised as an important consideration for fisheries management, as it can affect trends in catch rates, and be incorporated into planning of spatial management tools like marine protected areas (MPAs). One hundred and ninety-eight household questionnaires provided a coarse indication of effort distribution of artisanal lobster fishers around the Corn Islands, and 32 semi-structured interviews with skippers were used to map individual fishing sites and describe the operating costs and revenues of typical dive and trap-fishing operations. Artisanal fisheries had ranges of up to 50 km, and had moved significantly offshore within the previous 10 years. At the scale of a 5 ?? 5 min latitude/longitude grid, trap fishing effort was highly aggregated (dispersion coefficient = 3.5), while diving had a regular dispersion (d.c. = 0.1). Descriptions of catch composition at each site showed a clear spatial pattern in the distribution of two locally recognised types of lobster, potentially indicating local stock structures. Economic information was summarised into balance sheets for typical fishers and suggested that fuel accounted for about 52 and 37{\%} of the operating costs of dive and trap fishing captains, respectively. Qualitative questions highlighted trap theft, adoption of geographical positioning system (GPS) technology and fuel costs as major factors affecting spatial behaviour. The costs and benefits of using more distant grounds were examined by testing for relationships between stated typical catch rates and distance of 90 trap-fishing grounds and between fuel expenditure and catches in 291 daily records of the activities of 3 divers. Maximum catch rates stated by trap fishers were significantly higher at more distant sites and daily catches by divers had a positive relationship with fuel expenditure, which suggested that increasing fuel expenditure to target more distant sites would lead to higher gross revenue as well as higher net revenues, after considering variable operating costs. Thus, there appears to be an economic incentive to extend the range of the fishery. However, fishers may not perceive these positive trends in catch rate with distance due to catch variability, and costs other than fuel, which complicate the trade-off between catch and distance. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Marine fisheries are in decline and the existence of poorly defined property rights is a contributory cause of this decline. The allocation of property rights can bring benefits in terms of enhancing biological sustainability and economic profitability. However, to date few studies have analysed the behaviour of fishers who have been granted such property rights. Such studies are important if theoretical means of improving the sustainability of fisheries are to be tested in real world situations. In this study we assessed the financial decision-making behaviour of fishers when managing resources under a territorial user rights policy implemented in Chile. We used bidding games and semi-structured interviews to assess fishers' financial understanding and risk preferences. We defined risk preferences as the amount of potential catch fishers are willing to leave unharvested in return for a potential future increase in income from the natural growth in the resource. Results indicated that fishers' financial behaviour under similar revenue scenarios were largely determined by livelihood characteristics and not wealth. This reflected two major financial adaptation strategies that were split between different fishery sectors: a) specialist fishers (in our case divers) became risk acceptant when confronted with a scenario in which the mean body-size of the harvested species was small, and they were willing to 'invest' their natural resources by leaving some of their potential catch unharvested for a year, and b) more generalist fishers (here fin-fishers) were less inclined to leave potential catches unharvested. They preferred to have the money to invest in tangible assets such as fishing nets. This suggest that fishers' harvesting behaviour is heterogeneous and depends on whether fishers perceive themselves as facing potential gains or loses assessed against a personal expectation level. The use of Prospect theory may be appropriate to further elucidate fishers' behaviour under territorial user right frameworks. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, its origin in the social sciences belies the effectiveness of its interdisciplinary ambitions and undermines its ability to cope with ecological complexity. To narrow the gap between inherently dynamic ecological systems and the SES framework, we need to explicitly recognize that SES outcomes are coproduced by social systems in which choices are made, as well as an ecological system with a diverse assortment of dynamic natural processes that mediate the effect of those choices. We illustrate the need for more explicit incorporation of ecological attributes into the SES framework by presenting a case study of a community-managed forest in Indiana, USA. A preliminary set of ecological attributes are also proposed for inclusion in the SES framework with the aim of spurring interest in further development of a truly interdisciplinary framework for the study of SESs.},

Building on the analysis of car mobility patterns by means of web-based car trips diaries filled in by a sample of individuals in six European countries, this paper provides insights on how EDVs could fit mobility habits. Critical aspects related to driving behaviour, which should be considered to allow the penetration of electric cars in the market, are identified. Among others results, we show that average daily driven distance in 6 countries ranges from an average of 40. km (UK) to an average of 80. km (Poland) and the parking time after the last trip of a day amounts to more than 16. h per day.

abstract = {The impact of the management of packaging waste on the environment, economic growth and job creation is analyzed in this paper. This integrated assessment intends to cover a gap in the literature for this type of studies, using the specific case study of the Portuguese packaging waste management system (SIGRE). The net environmental benefits associated with the management of packaging waste, are calculated using the Life Cycle Assessment methodology. The results show that, for the categories studied, the impacts associated to SIGRE's various activities are surpassed by the benefits associated to material and energy recovery, with special focus on recycling. For example, in 2011 SIGRE avoided the emission of 116 kt CO2 equiv. - the equivalent carbon emission of the electricity consumption of 124.000 households in Portugal. The economic impact of SIGRE is evaluated through Input-Output Analysis. It was found that SIGRE's activities also have a significant economic impact. For example, their added value are ranked amongst the upper third of the economic activities with highest multiplier effect at national level: this means that for each Euro of value added generated within SIGRE, 1.25 additional ??? are added to the rest of the economy (multiplier effect of 2.25). Regarding the social impacts of SIGRE, the number of direct jobs associated with the system is estimated to be more than two thousand and three hundred workers. Out of these, 83{\%} are connected to the management of municipal waste packaging (selective collection and sorting), 15{\%} are connected to the management of non-municipal packaging waste and only 2{\%} are connected to the Sociedade Ponto Verde (SPV, green dot society in English) - the management entity responsible for SIGRE. In general terms, the results obtained provide quantitative support to the EEA (2011) suggestion that moving up the waste hierarchy - from landfilling to recycling - creates jobs and boosts the economy. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

'Strategic Niche Management' theory predicts that niche-level actors and networks will aggregate learning from local projects, disseminating best practice, and encouraging innovation diffusion. Grassroots innovations emerging from civil society are under-researched, and so we investigate the UK community energy sector to empirically test this model. Our analysis draws on qualitative case study research with local projects, and a study of how intermediary organisations support local projects. We examine the extent and nature of interactions and resource flows between projects and intermediary actors in order to evaluate the utility of niche theories in the civil society context. While networking and intermediary organisations can effectively spread some types of learning necessary for diffusion, this is not sufficient: tacit knowledge, trust and confidence are essential to these projects' success, but are more difficult to abstract and translate to new settings. We discuss the implications of our findings for niche theory, for community energy and other grassroots practitioners aiming to build robust influential niches, and for policymakers.},

abstract = {The “tragedy of the commons” is a central concept in human ecology and the study of the environment. The prototypical scenario is simple. There is a resource—usually referred to as a common-pool resource—to which a large number of people have access. The resource might be an oceanic ecosys- tem from which fish are harvested, the global atmosphere into which greenhouse gases are released, or a forest from which timber is harvested. Overuse of the resource creates problems, often destroying its sustainability. The fish population may collapse, climate change may ensue, or the forest might cease regrowing enough trees to replace those cut. Each user faces a decision about how much of the resource to use—how many fish to catch, how much greenhouse gases to emit, or how many trees to cut. If all users restrain themselves, then the resource can be sustained. But there is a dilemma. If you limit your use of the resources and your neighbors do not, then the resource still collapses and you have lost the short-term benefits of taking your share (Hardin, 1968).},

The physical basis for the scenarios is the exploitation of renewable energy resources already in progress in Denmark. Hydrogen is proposed as a convenient energy carrier due to its versatility in use, transmission and as an energy storage medium. Two main scenarios are constructed, differing in the degree of decentralisation of energy production and management: one resembles the current system with centralised facilities and commercial management, the other being based upon a projected scale-independent cost structure of energy producing and handling equipment, that will allow extreme decentralisation of the physical energy conversion system, possibly accompanied by a similar decentralisation of ownership and control. The simulation studies show that both scenarios are technically feasible, and that the storage problems arising from the mismatch between demand and intermittent sources can be solved in both a centralised and a decentralised fashion. ?? 2003 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

The activated carbons produced were characterized by carbon yield ({\%}), BET surface area, porosity development (total pore volume and micropore fraction). RSM based on a five-variable central composite rotatable design was used to determine the effect of chemical ratio (ranging from 0 to 4) and activation temperature (ranging from 500 °C to 900 °C) on the responses levels. Each response has been described by a second order model that was found to be appropriate to predict most of the responses in every experimental region. The most influential factor on each experimental design response have been identified from the analysis of variance (ANOVA). The optimum conditions for manufacturing of activated carbon from Turkish lignite, which were based on response surface and contour plots, were found as follows: chemical ratio of 2.05 and carbonization temperature of 800 °C. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The development of a typology of the Greek small-scale fishermen, based on socio-economic and fisheries information was examined using data from 551 fishermen interviews in 18 prefectures of Greece. The fishermen are relatively aged, they have mostly attained elementary education and their annual income is low. The catch is traded in both the wholesale and the retail market. The income from fisheries is significantly higher in continental than insular prefectures and higher in the Aegean than the Ionian Sea. The fishermen were categorised in three groups of dependence on fisheries (high, medium and low) according to the percentage of income originating from fishing, with more than 60{\%} of the fishermen belonging to the high dependence group. There were significant differences among these groups in the fishermen age, annual income from fisheries, vessel length and the yearly days of fishing activity. The nature of the fishing licensing system and its implications for management are discussed and also compared to other European and Mediterranean countries. The individual treatment of the identified groups in the licensing procedure is discussed with regard to its fisheries and social impact. The pronounced geographic features revealed by the study on the level of dependence on fishing suggest that the regional particularities, linked to ecosystem heterogeneity, should be considered carefully in the management process. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Despite an important small scale bivalve fishery in Peru, hardly any management plans are applied to exploit the resource. Furthermore, little of the ecological data necessary to develop management strategies have been published so far. The present paper deals with the fishery of the most important infaunal bivalve of Peru, Gari solida, from Bahia Independencia where the largest Peruvian population is located. Growth parameters of the yon Bertalanffy growth function were L∞ = 101.6 mm and k = 0.495, total mortality was Z = 1.64 [yr-1], fishing mortality F = 1.31 [yr-1] and mean natural mortality M̄ = 0.38 [yr-1]. Total biomass, calculated by direct sampling surveys was 627 t ash-free dry weight (AFDW) in August 1990, 435 t AFDW in February 1991 and 137 t AFDW in October 1991. The observed exploitation rate, calculated from Z and F was E = 0.80, whereas exploitation rate corresponding to the maximum yield (calculated by Beverton and Holt yield per recruit model) was E(max) = 0.65. Therefore, it is assumed that the biomass reduction (corresponding to a total decline of 78{\%}) was caused by fishing activities. Other sources reveal a decline of 92{\%} from 1990 to 1994. It is necessary to establish and apply management plans for a sustainable exploitation of this resource.},

abstract = {We analyze intra- and inter-annual harvesting and economic patterns of the cephalopod Octopus mimus (pulpo) artisanal fishery at Caleta Coloso cove, Antofagasta, northern Chile, between 1991 and 1996. Information was collected daily, from 25 hookah divers that manually harvest pulpo in the subtidal along 29 km of coastline. Inter-annual fluctuations in catch, fishing effort, unit price and economic revenues increased from 1993 to 1996, when O. mimus landing and total revenues at Coloso were over 77 t and US{\$} 190000, respectively. Contrary to the observed annual trend, the inverse intra-annual correlation between catch/fishing effort and price indicated short-term changes in price according to resource availability. A monotonic decreasing function between CPUE and price suggested a threshold catch rate economically feasible for harvesting. Inter-annual changes in the slope of the price-CPUE function indicated a marked increase in the demand of pulpo, jointly with warnings of stock depletion. We conclude that the O. mimus temporal fishery patterns at Coloso are scale-dependent. Our results and general fishery patterns in the Chilean pulpo fishery suggest that a precautionary management scheme is urgently needed to prevent overfishing.},

Rapid economic growth has helped China to become one of the most important world economic powers, increasing the wealth of the population and providing employment and business opportunities. The rapid economic growth, however has engendered serious natural resource depletion and environmental pollution, and the continuing increase of population has exacerbated this situation. As the results of resource depletion and environmental negligence have become visible, Chinese society and decision makers have realized the seriousness of the situation.

@article{Dennis1992,
abstract = {Ornate rock lobsters Panulirus ornatus, which emigrate from Torres Strait (north-east Australia) to breed each year, support a seasonal artisanal lobster fishery at Yule Island (eastern Gulf of Papua). The catches are highest in mid-January through mid-February, but then decline rapidly, so by late-March virtually no lobsters remain. It has been hypothesised that most of the decline in catch is due to natural mortality caused by the stress of migrating and breeding. However, there are alternative explanations: fishing mortality may be extremely high, or lobsters may move to deeper habitat, not accessible to divers. These hypotheses were examined through a combination of (i) deploying tangle nets in deep water near the main fishing area, (ii) daily monitoring of the catch and effort of the artisanal fishery, (iii) a tag-recapture study and (iv) daily assessment of physiological condition, using the water content of the hepatopancreas as an index. The tangle net catches showed that female lobsters temporarily moved into deeper water just off the reef to hatch their eggs at the January and February full moons, but then moved back onto the reef. Their emigration did not coincide with the decline in artisanal catch. The annual instantaneous total mortality rates (Zann), estimated from catch per unit effort (CPUE) curves, were extremely high: Zann = 11.6 for females and Zann = 12.0 for males. About one-third of the tags were returned. Analysis of the tag-return rate and total catch suggested the initial population was 19000-30000 lobsters. The total mortality rate, estimated from the tag-recapture data (Zann = 10.2), was consistent with the very high estimate from CPUE data. The annual instantaneous fishing mortality rate indicated that the fishery was responsible for about one-third of the mortality (Zann = 4.4), which corresponded well the proportion of tags returned. The remainder of the decline in catch was attributed to natural mortality. The hepatopancreas water content indicated that most lobsters were in poor condition. These results support the original hypothesis that there is extremely high mortality in this breeding population, a phenomenon not reported in any other species of lobster. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {In order to move towards a more sustainable development, it is necessary not only to minimize the use of materials in the design stage and to find new materials as alternatives to nonrenewable ones (e.g. optical fiber instead of copper, biopolymers instead of polymers from oil) but also to reclaim as much as possible material value through effective recycling. To this extent, recycling can play a key role in multiple dimensions, while providing new business opportunities for innovative companies, having positive impacts on the society and the environment and fostering an effective circular economy as well. Because of the advanced waste management infrastructures available in developed countries, it is possible to achieve an almost complete collection of solid wastes into a variety of controlled bulk material flows. However, the picture for the follow-up step, the recycling of raw materials such as steel, non-ferrous metals, polymers and glass from these flows, is less positive. Materials value recovered from waste represents a very small fraction of European GDP. The fundamental issue is that policymakers still lack an effective key performance indicator for stimulating the recycling industry. Therefore although recycling plays an important role in the circular economy perspective, it is necessary to radically change the metric used so far to compute the recycling rate. Nowadays, the recycling rate is computed measuring the amount of material entering the recycling facilities. This approach has brought about an inaccurate and somehow misleading indicator (the recycling rate) which contributed to wrong decision making and to poor innovation in the industry. The new approach proposed in this paper considers the use of a Circular Economy Index (CEI) as the ratio of the material value produced by the recycler (market value) by the intrinsic material value1 entering the recycling facility.},

abstract = {This project aimed to develop co-management of exploited marine fishery resources in Barbados using the sea urchin fishery as a test case. The approach was to work with stakeholders, primarily the fishers, to establish a co-management mechanism that could be operated by the fishers themselves with technical and advisory support from the Fisheries Division. The project used Technology of Participation (TOP) methodology, developed by the Institute of Cultural Affairs (ICA). ToP methods used included Focused Conversation and Participatory Strategic Planning. To our knowledge, this methodology has not previously been applied in small-scale fisheries co-management. Fishers involvement was developed in stages: identification of groups of fishers in communities and a contact person for the group; dialogue with individuals and the small groups; discussion in larger groups to derive approaches to management; and full group participation to reach consensus regarding the most appropriate approach to management. Key persons identified in communities helped organize meetings to discuss the sea urchin fishery. From these community meetings, individuals were selected to take part in the strategic planning. Two vision meetings with separate groups of fishers, produced similar results. These groups were combined at a planning meeting, where fishers examined the blocks to achieving the vision, developed strategies to overcome the blocks, and an action plan to implement the strategies. Fishers and government officials concluded that the methodology had successfully facilitated the input of both parties and produced a workable, consensual approach. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

After discussing briefly the major findings and accomplishments of the scholar ship on the commons, the paper pursues two strategies of critique. The first strategy of friendly critique accepts the basic assumptions of most writings on common property to show that scholars of commons have discovered far more variables that potentially affect resource management than is possible to analyze carefully. The paper identifies some potential means to address the problem of too many variables. The second line of critique proceeds differently. It asks how analyses of common property might change, and what they need to consider, if they loosen assumptions about sovereign selves and apolitical property rights institutions. My examination of these questions concludes this review with an emphasis on the need to (a) attend more carefully to processes of subject formation, and (b) investigate common property arrangements and associated subject positions with greater historical depth},

Bonga, Ethmalosa fimbriata, dominated the catch of the coastal/estuarine fisheries; in the freshwater sector, the catfish Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus was the dominant (albeit relatively seasonal) species in the landings. Regression/correlation analysis indicated positive linear relationships between the mean monthly catch (Y (MA)) as well as the catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) (Yf-1 (MA)) of the marine inshore fisheries and air and water temperatures (??A and ??W, respectively) and estuarine salinity (SAL). No such linear relationships were observed in the case of freshwater fish catch (Y (FW)); however, the regression of CPUE (i.e., Yf-1 (FW)) on the river/floodplain water level gave a highly significant negative correlation reflecting the difficulty of catching fish in the very much expanded volume of water during floods. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {In a classical paper, Hutchinson (1961) argued that the large number of species in most plankton communities is remarkable in view of the competitive exclusion principle, which suggests that in homogeneous, well-mixed environments species that compete for the same resources cannot coexist. Few ideas in aquatic ecology have evoked more research than this 'paradox of the plankton'. This review is an effort to put the main solutions to the paradox that have been proposed over the years into perspective. Hutchinson himself already suggested that the explanation could be that plankton communities are not in equilibrium at all due to weather-driven fluctuations. Subsequent research confirmed that such externally imposed variability can allow many species to coexist. Another important point is that in practice the homogeneous well-mixed conditions assumed in the competitive exclusion principle hardly exist. Even the open ocean, for instance, has a spatial complexity resulting from meso-scale vortices and fronts that can facilitate coexistence of species. Perhaps most excitingly, theoretical work on species interactions has given a counter-intuitive new dimension to the understanding of diversity. Various competition and predation models suggest that even in homogeneous and constant environments plankton will never settle to equilibrium. Instead, interactions between multiple species may give rise to oscillations and chaos, with a continuous wax and wane of species within the community. Long-term laboratory experiments support this view. This chaotic behavior implies among other things that plankton dynamics are intrinsically unpredictable in the long run when viewed in detail. Nonetheless, on a higher aggregation level, indicators such as total algal biomass may show quite regular patterns.},

abstract = {Steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3/AIB1) interacts with steroid receptors in a ligand-dependent manner to activate receptor-mediated transcription. A number of intracellular signaling pathways initiated by growth factors and hormones induce phosphorylation of SRC-3, regulating its function and contributing to its oncogenic potential. However, the range of mechanisms by which phosphorylation affects coactivator function remains largely undefined. We demonstrate here that peptidyl-prolyl isomerase 1 (Pin1), which catalyzes the isomerization of phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro peptide bonds to induce conformational changes of its target proteins, interacts selectively with phosphorylated SRC-3. In addition, Pin1 and SRC-3 activate nuclear-receptor-regulated transcription synergistically. Depletion of Pin1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduces hormone-dependent transcription from both transfected reporters and an endogenous steroid receptor target gene. We present evidence that Pin1 modulates interactions between SRC-3 and CBP/p300. The interaction is enhanced in vitro and in vivo by Pin1 and diminished when cellular Pin1 is reduced by siRNA or in stable Pin1-depleted cell lines. Depletion of Pin1 in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells reduces the endogenous estrogen-dependent recruitment of p300 to the promoters of estrogen receptor-dependent genes. Pin1 overexpression enhanced SRC-3 cellular turnover, and depletion of Pin1 stabilized SRC-3. Our results suggest that Pin1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator of nuclear receptors by modulating SRC-3 coactivator protein-protein complex formation and ultimately by also promoting the turnover of the activated SRC-3 oncoprotein.},

abstract = {As the human population grows and natural resources decline, there is pressure to apply increasing levels of top-down, command-and-control management to natural resources. This is manifested in attempts to control ecosystems and in socioeconomic institutions that respond to erratic or surprising ecosystem behavior with more control. Command and control, however, usually results in unforeseen consequences for both natural ecosystems and human welfare in the form of collapsing resources, social and economic strife, and losses of biological diversity. We describe the “pathology of natural resource management,” defined as a loss of system resilience when the range of natural variation in the system is reduced encapsulates the unsustainable environmental, social, and economic outcomes of command-and-control resource management. If natural levels of variation in system behavior are reduced through command-and-control, then the system becomes less resilient to external perturbations, resulting in crises and surprises. We provide several examples of this pathology in management. An ultimate pathology emerges when resource management agencies, through initial success with command and control, lose sight of their original purposes, eliminate research and monitoring, and focus on efficiency of control. They then become isolated from the managed systems and inflexible in structure. Simultaneously, through overcapitalization, society becomes dependent upon command and control, demands it in greater intensity, and ignores the underlying ecological change or collapse that is developing. Solutions to this pathology cannot come from further command and control (regulations) but must come from innovative approaches involving incentives leading to more resilient ecosystems, more flexible agencies, more self-reliant industries, and a more knowledgeable citizenry. We discuss several aspects of ecosystem pattern and dynamics at large scales that provide insight into ecosystem resilience, and we propose a “Golden Rule” of natural resource management that we believe is necessary for sustainability: management should strive to retain critical types and ranges of natural variation in resource systems in order to maintain their resiliency.},

abstract = {This investigation examines the economics of producing electricity from proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell systems under various conditions, including the possibility of using fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) to produce power when they are parked at office buildings and residences. The analysis shows that the economics of both stationary fuel cell and FCV-based power vary significantly with variations in key input variables such as the price of natural gas, electricity prices, fuel cell and reformer system costs, and fuel cell system durability levels. The "central case" results show that stationary PEM fuel cell systems can supply electricity for offices and homes in California at a net savings when fuel cell system costs reach about {\$}6000 for a 5 kW home system ({\$}1200/kW) and {\$}175,000 for a 250 kW commercial system ({\$}700/kW) and assuming somewhat favorable natural gas costs of {\$}6/GJ at residences and {\$}4/GJ at commercial buildings. Grid-connected FCVs in commercial settings can also potentially supply electricity at competitive rates, in some cases producing significant annual benefits. Particularly attractive is the combination of net metering along with time-of-use electricity rates that allow power to be supplied to the utility grid at the avoided cost of central power plant generation. FCV-based power at individual residences does not appear to be as attractive, at least where FCV power can only be used directly or banked with the utility for net metering and not sold in greater quantity, due to the low load levels at these locations that provide a poor match to automotive fuel cell operation, higher natural gas prices than are available at commercial settings, and other factors. ?? 2002 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{TheCLubofRome2015,
abstract = {The central theme of this report is how to greatly enhance resource efficiency. The proposition is that a circular economy, where products are designed for ease of recycling, reuse, disassembly and remanufacturing should replace the traditional, linear 'take, make {\&} dispose' model that has dominated the economy so far. This, no doubt, is a major prerequisite to stay within the Planetary Boundaries. It now takes the Earth almost one and a half year to regenerate what we use in a year (Ecological Footprint). Both governments and businesses are beginning to realize that our linear systems of resource use expose both societies and businesses to a number of serious risks. Resource constraints as well as increasing volumes of waste and pollution are likely to impose increasing threats to welfare and wellbeing and, from a business point of view, to competitiveness, profits and business continuity. Simply put: We are in urgent need of decoupling, or put in other words, a transition to an inclusive and circular economy. The 'circular economy' is an industrial system that is restorative by intention and design. The idea is that rather than discarding products before their value are fully utilized, we should use and re-use them. Presently only a few percentage points of the original product value is recovered after use. While relative decoupling of economic growth from resource use has been happening over the past decades, the gains made so far have been rapidly eaten up by a combination of economic growth and the so-called rebound effect, i.e. that the resources freed up by increased efficiency are used up very soon through increased consumption. Here is where the circular economy as a powerful concept comes into play. Most studies so far on the circular economy have focused primarily on the business case for enhanced resource efficiency. This report rather focuses on the social benefits that a transformation from a linear to a circular economy would entail. The main purpose of this report is to broadly explore the potential for a significant increase in resource efficiency and to specifically assess what the main benefits for society would be – looking at carbon emissions and employment in particular. We are using the Swedish Economy as a test case. In the full version of our report, to be released in June/July 2015, the Dutch and Spanish Economies will be examined as well. Our hypothesis is that the circular economy as a concept will offer a number of societal benefits for Europe, not least in terms of carbon emissions reductions and job gains. To draw such conclusions at the general level, however, will require studies pertaining to more than one member-state. The study is relevant not only from an academic but also from a political perspective, not least in the EU context. The European Commission took several important initiatives in the area of resource efficiency during the years 2011-2014, culminating with the Circular Economy Package. Regretful as it is, the Juncker Commission decided to withdraw the proposal under the pretext of “deregulation”. After a lot of critique the Commission has made a commitment to re-launch the proposal. We hope that this report can provide input for the Commission's new proposal, particularly in terms of recognizing the Circular Economy as a key instrument for Mr Juncker's competitiveness and jobs agenda.},

abstract = {The coral reefs of Papua New Guinea are among the most species diverse in the world, support an important artisanal fishery, but lack an effective nationalconservationprogramme. Increased commercialization, population growth, promotion of fisheries development projects, and the live reef food fish trade are expected to increase demand for the country's reef fish. This paper examines how socioeconomic factors affect the condition of the artisanal multi-species coral reef fishery in six sites in Papua New Guinea. Catch characteristics such as diversity, trophic level and body size by landing site were examined along a fishing pressure gradient. Both exogenous factors such as markets and endogenous factors such asfishing pressure were related to the condition of fish catch. In general, the trophic level and lengths of fish captured in Papua New Guinea were relatively high, but were reduced on reefs with high fishing effort near fish markets. Fisheries showed signs of depletion above c. 25 fishing trips per km2 per day and the proximity of markets was a better indicator of overfishing than human population size. A cross-scale approach to fisheries management is required in Papua New Guinea to coordinate decentralized local management, limit the intrusion of extractive enterprises, and develop policies that seek to minimize exogenous pressures on marine resources.},

abstract = {This is the first regional study of artisanal fisheries in Pacific Island countries and territories that demonstrated that the future of the region's artisanal fishery sector and the livelihood of coastal communities will be highly dependent on alternative subsistence and income sources, which are necessary to reduce fishing pressure to a sustainable level to maintain ecosystem services and food security. The overall objective of this study was to identify socio-economic indicators and drivers to improve the understanding of the dynamics between socio-economic conditions and current exploitation levels of finfish and invertebrates of coastal communities in 17 Pacific Island countries and territories. We showed that exploitation rates and thus possible overexploitation are not solely the consequence of a simple demographic growth process but are in fact a result of the choices people have. Our results confirmed a close relationship between resource exploitation rates and economic development at the national level and the availability of alternative income opportunities at the community level. Multivariate analysis results suggest that communities in countries with somewhat unfavourable conditions and limited access to alternatives and fishing households in communities with overall favourable economic conditions are at highest vulnerability as they have the highest dependence on coastal fisheries resources. Alternative economic opportunities at the national scale and availability of alternative income at the community level vary significantly between cultural groups. Based on our results, the development of management strategies with realistic expectations of ensuring livelihood of coastal communities and sustainable resource use in Pacific Island countries and territories requires a hierarchical and integral approach. Major drivers identified at the regional, cultural and local levels should be used to identify priorities, to assess overall advantages and limitations at the different levels as well as the vulnerability of communities targeted, and to develop strategies accordingly. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Outsiders are eager to gain access, and the community has devised a set of rules to allow them in. Because Seri govern- ment officials keep all the economic benefits generated from granting this access for themselves, community members create alternative entry mechanisms to divert those benefits to themselves. Under Hardin's model of the tragedy of the commons, this situation would eventually lead to the overexploitation of the fishery. The Seri people, however, are able to simultaneously maintain access and use controls for the continuing sustainability of their fishing grounds.

@article{Cudney-Bueno2009,
abstract = {Community-based management and the establishment of marine reserves have been advocated worldwide as means to overcome overexploitation of fisheries. Yet, researchers and managers are divided regarding the effectiveness of these measures. The “tragedy of the commons” model is often accepted as a universal paradigm, which assumes that unless managed by the State or privatized, common-pool resources are inevitably overexploited due to conflicts between the self-interest of individuals and the goals of a group as a whole. Under this paradigm, the emergence and maintenance of effective community-based efforts that include cooperative risky decisions as the establishment of marine reserves could not occur. In this paper, we question these assumptions and show that outcomes of commons dilemmas can be complex and scale-dependent. We studied the evolution and effectiveness of a community-based management effort to establish, monitor, and enforce a marine reserve network in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Our findings build on social and ecological research before (1997–2001), during (2002) and after (2003–2004) the establishment of marine reserves, which included participant observation in {\textgreater}100 fishing trips and meetings, interviews, as well as fishery dependent and independent monitoring. We found that locally crafted and enforced harvesting rules led to a rapid increase in resource abundance. Nevertheless, news about this increase spread quickly at a regional scale, resulting in poaching from outsiders and a subsequent rapid cascading effect on fishing resources and locally-designed rule compliance. We show that cooperation for management of common-pool fisheries, in which marine reserves form a core component of the system, can emerge, evolve rapidly, and be effective at a local scale even in recently organized fisheries. Stakeholder participation in monitoring, where there is a rapid feedback of the systems response, can play a key role in reinforcing cooperation. However, without cross-scale linkages with higher levels of governance, increase of local fishery stocks may attract outsiders who, if not restricted, will overharvest and threaten local governance. Fishers and fishing communities require incentives to maintain their management efforts. Rewarding local effective management with formal cross-scale governance recognition and support can generate these incentives.},

abstract = {One billion people depend on seafood as their primary source of protein and 25{\%} of the world's total animal protein comes from fisheries. Yet a third of fish stocks worldwide are overexploited or depleted. Using individual case studies, many have argued that community-based co-management should prevent the tragedy of the commons because cooperative management by fishers, managers and scientists often results in sustainable fisheries. However, general and multidisciplinary evaluations of co-management regimes and the conditions for social, economic and ecological success within such regimes are lacking. Here we examine 130 co-managed fisheries in a wide range of countries with different degrees of development, ecosystems, fishing sectors and type of resources. We identified strong leadership as the most important attribute contributing to success, followed by individual or community quotas, social cohesion and protected areas. Less important conditions included enforcement mechanisms, long-term management policies and life history of the resources. Fisheries were most successful when at least eight co-management attributes were present, showing a strong positive relationship between the number of these attributes and success, owing to redundancy in management regulations. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of prominent community leaders and robust social capital, combined with clear incentives through catch shares and conservation benefits derived from protected areas, for successfully managing aquatic resources and securing the livelihoods of communities depending on them. Our study offers hope that co-management, the only realistic solution for the majority of the world's fisheries, can solve many of the problems facing global fisheries.},

Although much of this writing acknowledges the importance of a large number of different causal variables and processes, knowledge about the magnitude, relative contribution, and even direction of influence of different causal processes on resource management outcomes is still poor at best. This paper addresses existing gaps in theory and knowledge by conducting a context-sensitive statistical analysis of 95 cases of decentralized, community-based, forest governance in Himachal Pradesh, and showing how a range of causal influences shape forest conditions in diverse ecological and institutional settings in the Indian Himalaya.

abstract = {Scale mismatches result in incomplete or ambiguous feedback that impairs the ability to learn and adapt and, ultimately, to sustain natural resources. Our aim is to examine the sea urchin fishery in Maine, USA to better understand the multiscale, social, and biophysical conditions that are important for the design of institutions that might be able to sustain the resource. During the late 1980s and 1990s, the Maine sea urchin fishery was a classic gold rush fishery. In the beginning, the fishery was characterized by an abundant resource with little to no harvesting activity, followed by a period of rapid increase in landings and effort that led to a subsequent and persistent decline in the sea urchin population and a significant reduction in effort. We conducted semistructured interviews with scientists and experienced fishermen to understand the multiscale, social, and biophysical conditions that influence fishermen's harvesting strategies, and the implications of this for the design of institutions for successful resource management. The current co-management system includes an advisory body made up of industry members and scientists it also includes limited entry, and additional input control mechanisms. Many of these measures are implemented at a very broad scale; however, we find that the ecological conditions relevant to the sustainable processes occur at the scale of individual fishing sites or ledges, which is a much finer scale than current management. Therefore, the co- management system maintains an open access system and leaves few incentives for the development of sustainable harvesting strategies among fishermen. The clear suggestion is that the appropriate management system would be one that directly addresses the fine scale ecological and social dynamics within this fishery and gives fishermen property rights over individual ledges (for example, leases). After having briefly reviewed experiences in Canada and Chile, we found that knowledge of the coupled natural and human system at the fine scale is necessary if we are to assess the feasibility of area management in this fishery, because what works in one fishery does not necessarily work in another.},

abstract = {In order to avoid conflicts when spatially explicit rules are implemented, it is critical to understand the spatial distribution of fishing effort, the migration patterns of fishermen and the use of temporary fishing camps. The migration of fishermen is a process shaped by historical patterns of resource availability, in addition to economic and political factors. We present an example in which a temporary fishing camp used for extraction of benthic resources (Loco: Concholepas concholepas) changed into a permanent one during the study period. Throughout the study period fishing effort (trips) was closely related to the productivity of the different fishing grounds, with more trips directed to the most productive areas. The conversion from a temporary to a permanent fishing camp did not improve the efficiency of the loco fishery, but did allow better access to alternative resources (surf clams) on nearby fishing grounds. The succession from simple shelters to a permanent 'caleta' is a common situation along the Chilean coast, motivated originally by resource availability and more recently by the creation of the TURF system. In??particular the TURF system converts temporary (resource driven) movements of fishermen into rigid stationary caletas, which creates a number of problems. Temporary fishing camps are common when fishing grounds are far from the base port, but they require specific administrative tools in order to achieve sustainable fisheries management. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The articles in this special feature challenge the presumption that scholars can make simple, predictive models of social-ecological systems (SESs) and deduce universal solutions, panaceas, to problems of overuse or destruction of resources. Moving beyond panaceas to develop cumulative capacities to diagnose the problems and potentialities of linked SESs requires serious study of complex, multivariable, nonlinear, cross-scale, and changing systems. Many variables have been identified by researchers as affecting the patterns of interactions and outcomes observed in empirical studies of SESs. A step toward developing a diagnostic method is taken by organizing these variables in a nested, multitier framework. The framework enables scholars to organize analyses of how attributes of (i) a resource system (e.g., fishery, lake, grazing area), (ii) the resource units generated by that system (e.g., fish, water, fodder), (iii) the users of that system, and (iv) the governance system jointly affect and are indirectly affected by interactions and resulting outcomes achieved at a particular time and place. The framework also enables us to organize how these attributes may affect and be affected by larger socioeconomic, political, and ecological settings in which they are embedded, as well as smaller ones. The framework is intended to be a step toward building a strong interdisciplinary science of complex, multilevel systems that will enable future diagnosticians to match governance arrangements to specific problems embedded in a social-ecological context.},

abstract = {The study evaluates the status of small-scale fishermaen and fishing operations, using socio-economic indicators and economic viability estimates in six selected fishing areas of Turkey during the 2002-2003 fishing season. Fifty-six percent of all small-scale fishing boats investigatd achieved a positive net profit, fully recovering their operational and investment costs. Considering the viability of the fishery, 56{\%} can be considered as economically viable. Percentages of negative gross cash flow (GCF) for eac of the vessels in the district was 56{\%} in Foca, 57{\%} in Karaburun, 15{\%} in Mordogan, 16{\%} in Akyaka, 65{\%} in Akcapinar, 44{\%} in Marmaris. On the other hand, when sustainability is defined with more than an economic performance ratio of 10{\%}, only 41{\$} of the small-scale fishing vessels seem to have shown favourable results. Criteria such as comparatively higher catch, smaller crew size and lower labour costs, structure of the fishery or misreporting might have had a slight role in affecting the overall results which indicate that livlihood and economic viability there are threatened by irregular and relatively low income levels in the small-scale fisheries sector. Given the economic conditions of small-scale fishing communities, it is suggested that all persons concerned at the community, industry and government levels should take a fresh look at the problem of sustainability. As such more attention needs to be paid to the fishery management option by looking at performance data and having long-term monitoring of the socio-economic indicators.},

The three smallest specimens (ranging from 40 to 49.8 g) attained an average weight of 558 g in 70 days. Growth of this species had two phases. Growth was exponential during the first 40 days of culture with an average G of 5.33{\%}. It slowed and became logarithmic when the animals attained weights ranging from 326.6 to 439 g. Instantaneous relative growth rate decreased from 2.25{\%} to 0.99{\%} during the logarithmic phase. A similar pattern was found for the 16 larger specimens (61.4-406.4 g initial weight). The change in growth pattern observed between the exponential and logarithmic phases occurred at body weights ranging from 326.6 to 454.2 g. No differences in growth were found between sexes in O. mimus. The growth pattern of this species is discussed and compared to other small-egged octopus species raised in captivity.},

abstract = {Ostrom's framework to analyse the sustainability of social-ecological systems has attracted great interest in the last years. It was not conceived to characterise systems, but its nature and structure make it very appealing to be used with this objective. However, its use to characterise three social-ecological systems where common-pool resource management is central created some methodological struggles and difficulties for comparing outcomes. This paper aims to present some adaptations developed for improving the framework's comprehensiveness and practical applicability at local level, such as a transdisciplinary description of the second-level variables, the definition of a set of third-level variables to facilitate and enrich the descriptions and additional guidelines for gathering the information and planning data searching processes at local level. The whole process of adapting and applying the framework was the result of collaboration among scientists, and local researchers and stakeholders. The adapted framework permitted a comprehensive and comparable characterisation of the social- ecological systems analysed and facilitated its use by the local communities.},

@article{Kerschner2010,
abstract = {In recent years the concept of economic de-growth (decroissance) based on the literature of Nicolas Georgescu-Roegen e.g. [1-3] has found a revival in France, Italy, Spain and other countries, in the popular as well as in the academic literature. Therein authors took on board Georgescu-Roegens' categorical rejection of a steady-state economy (SSE), as proposed by Herman Daly [4]. They argue that economic de-growth is the only viable alternative goal to the growing economy. This position is challenged in this article and it is concluded that the two concepts are in fact complements. Economic de-growth is not a goal in itself, but the rich North's path towards a globally equitable SSE. Moreover the de-growth literature can benefit from the strong economic historic roots of the SSE and from Daly's macroeconomic concepts, while in return being able to give lessons about bottom-up approaches. This would be particularly important for the population issue, where Daly proposes limited birth licences. Unfortunately statements on demography are inconsistent and underdeveloped in the de-growth literature. Further it is concluded that most criticisms of the SSE are due to a too narrow and technocratic interpretation of the concept. Instead the SSE should be defined as a quasi steady-state, resting in a dynamic equilibrium and as an "unattainable goal", which can and probably should be approximated. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present article, the available information from various reports on product lifespan was reviewed. Although we found a large number of data for many durables, the definition of lifespan in published articles varied, which limited our ability to compare reported values. We therefore first defined lifespan and then compared the international and historical data. We compiled more than 1,300 data sets from various sources and identified some differences among the types of goods and among regions. With the reviewed data noted in this article, we established a database, named LiVES (Lifespan Database for Vehicles, Equipment, and Structures), and will disclose it on the Internet to share the information.},

abstract = {Recycling and remanufacturing activities are gaining in importance, as a growing population and economy use up and wear out modern products, exhaust landfill capacity, threaten the environment, and discard potentially valuable and increasingly scarce resources. As an example, an estimated five billion pounds of carpet were sent to landfills in 2003 (CARE, 2003). Likewise, Americans discard computers, cell phones, LCDs and other electronic devices at an alarming rate. Estimates range from 100 to 250 million such items each year. As discard volumes rise and as resource scarcity becomes more critical, recycling, re-use, and remanufacturing have begun to take hold at ever more substantial scales. To understand the implications of these activities for economic development and sustainability, new methods of tracking their impacts must be developed. While at first blush it might be assumed that these activities could be modeled as could any other new industry, a number of characteristics peculiar to recycling and remanufacturing complicate the process. This paper enumerates a number of such dimensions of recycling, re-use, and remanufacturing, and lays out a scheme for extending the traditional approach.},

abstract = {This 'Cost of Non-Europe' study examines the current economic, social and legal state of play regarding the sharing economy in the European Union, and identifies the cost of the lack of further European action in this field. The assessment of existing EU and national legislation confirms that there are still significant implementation gaps and areas of poor economic performance. The subsequent examination of areas where it was believed that an economic potential exists highlighted that substantial barriers remain, hindering the achievement of the goals set out in the existing legislation. Moreover, some issues are not or are insufficiently addressed (e.g. status of workers employed by sharing economy service providers). Consequently, more European action would be necessary to achieve the full economic potential of the sharing economy. In doing so, policy-makers should seek to ensure an adequate balance between creative freedom for business and the necessary regulatory protection. This research estimates the potential economic gain linked with a better use of capacities (otherwise under-used) as a result of the sharing economy is €572 billion in annual consumption across the EU-28. This figure should nevertheless be considered with caution; substantial barriers prevent the full benefits from being realised, and could reduce the value of potential increased use to up to €18 billion in the shorter-term and up to €134 billion in the medium  and longer term, depending on the scale of regulatory obstacles.},

The CAS movement is predominantly American, as opposed to the European “natural science” tradition in the area of cybernetics and systems. Like in cybernetics and systems theory, CAS shares the subject of general properties of complex systems across traditional disciplinary boundaries. However, CAS is distinguished by the extensive use of computer simulations as a research tool, and an emphasis on systems, such as markets or ecologies, which are less integrated or “organized” than the ones studied by the older tradition (e.g., organisms, machines and companies).},

abstract = {For the development of material, product and waste oriented policies, knowledge about the flow, use and disposal of materials through society is necessary. The risks of taking policy measures leading to suboptimum solutions of environmental problems call for an integral survey of material flows through society. However, up to now, integral analyses of physical material flows have been lacking. Problems such as differences in definitions, in subdivisions of flows and in reference years make it difficult to relate data from different sources to obtain an overall view. In this article, STREAMS, a new method to calculate physical material flows through society, is proposed. The method is based on the so-called supply and use tables, which describe a country's economy in terms of supply and use of materials, products and services by industries, service sectors and consumers. In our approach, materials and products are tracked on their way from extraction of raw materials to the final consumption of products and beyond, into the stage of waste. The method has the advantage of deriving almost all data from one source. In this article the method is described. In a separate study, the method is applied to obtain an integral survey of the flow of plastics through The Netherlands, showing that the method can be used to assess the final materials consumption on a highly detailed level.

abstract = {As the world's largest CO(2) emitter and steel producer, China has set the ambitious goal of establishing a circular economy which aims at reconciling economic development with environmental protection and sustainable resource use. This work applies dynamic material flow analysis to forecast production, recycling, and iron ore consumption in the Chinese steel cycle until 2100 by using steel services in terms of in-use stock per capita as driver of future development. The whole cycle is modeled to determine possible responses of the steel industry in light of the circular economy concept. If per-capita stock saturates at 8-12 tons as evidence from industrialized countries suggests, consumption may peak between 2015 and 2020, whereupon it is likely to drop by up to 40{\%} until 2050. A slower growing in-use stock could mitigate this peak and hence reduce overcapacity in primary production. Old scrap supply will increase substantially and it could replace up to 80{\%} of iron ore as resource for steel making by 2050. This would require advanced recycling technologies as manufacturers of machinery and transportation equipment would have to shift to secondary steel as well as new capacities in secondary production which could, however, make redundant already existing integrated steel plants.},

abstract = {Under an extended producer responsibility (EPR) system, when a producer delivers a product to the market it must also pay a takeback fee, which is used to cover the costs of end-of-life disposal. EPR systems are currently used in Europe and beyond to manage a variety of products, including packaging and used tires. In this article we develop an inputoutput (IO) model that is able to assess the impacts of an EPR system, and is based on the waste IO (WIO) model. The WIO model is itself a hybrid-unit model extension of the Leontief model that is able to capture the substitution effect between recycled/recovered material/energy from waste treatment and their non-waste cognates. The resulting EPRIO model, besides the conventional direct and indirect effects of the Leontief model and the substitution effects of the WIO model, is able to capture the opportunity costs of financing the EPR system, and additionally requires the specification of an alternative waste management policy, with its own opportunity costs. The impact of an EPR policy is thus the difference between the impacts of the reference EPR and the alternative waste treament policies. The resulting model is illustrated with a simple example of a used tire management EPR system.},

IE deals with stocks and flows in interconnected networks of industry and the environment, which relies on a basic framework for analysis. Among others, Input-Output Analysis (IOA) is recognized as a key conceptual and analytical framework for IE. A major challenge is that the field of IOA manifests a long history since the 1930s with two Nobel Prize Laureates in the field and requires considerable analytical rigor. This led many instructors and researchers to call for a high-quality publication on the subject which embraces both state-of-the-art theory and principles as well as practical applications.},

abstract = {It is increasingly recognized that the growing metabolism of society is approaching limitations both with respect to sources for resource inputs and sinks for waste and emission outflows. The circular economy {\{}(CE){\}} is a simple, but convincing, strategy, which aims at reducing both input of virgin materials and output of wastes by closing economic and ecological loops of resource flows. This article applies a sociometabolic approach to assess the circularity of global material flows. All societal material flows globally and in the European Union {\{}(EU-27){\}} are traced from extraction to disposal and presented for main material groups for 2005. Our estimate shows that while globally roughly 4 gigatonnes per year {\{}(Gt/yr){\}} of waste materials are recycled, this flow is of moderate size compared to {\{}62{\~{}}Gt/yr{\}} of processed materials and outputs of {\{}41{\~{}}Gt/yr.{\}} The low degree of circularity has two main reasons: First, 44{\%} of processed materials are used to provide energy and are thus not available for recycling. Second, socioeconomic stocks are still growing at a high rate with net additions to stocks of {\{}17{\~{}}Gt/yr.{\}} Despite having considerably higher end-of-life recycling rates in the {\{}EU,{\}} the overall degree of circularity is low for similar reasons. Our results indicate that strategies targeting the output side (end of pipe) are limited given present proportions of flows, whereas a shift to renewable energy, a significant reduction of societal stock growth, and decisive eco-design are required to advance toward a {\{}CE.{\}}},

abstract = {We have developed a new series of environmentally extended multi-region input-output (MRIO) tables with applications in carbon, water, and ecological footprinting, and Life-Cycle Assessment, as well as trend and key driver analyses. Such applications have recently been at the forefront of global policy debates, such as about assigning responsibility for emissions embodied in internationally traded products. The new time series was constructed using advanced parallelized supercomputing resources, and significantly advances the previous state of art because of four innovations. First, it is available as a continuous 20-year time series of MRIO tables. Second, it distinguishes 187 individual countries comprising more than 15,000 industry sectors, and hence offers unsurpassed detail. Third, it provides information just 1-3 years delayed therefore significantly improving timeliness. Fourth, it presents MRIO elements with accompanying standard deviations in order to allow users to understand the reliability of data. These advances will lead to material improvements in the capability of applications that rely on input-output tables. The timeliness of information means that analyses are more relevant to current policy questions. The continuity of the time series enables the robust identification of key trends and drivers of global environmental change. The high country and sector detail drastically improves the resolution of Life-Cycle Assessments. Finally, the availability of information on uncertainty allows policy-makers to quantitatively judge the level of confidence that can be placed in the results of analyses.},

@article{yellishetty_iron_2010,
abstract = {Material flow analysis is an analysis of the flow of a material into and out of a particular region. The flow analysis also includes estimation of energy expended and of environmental emissions at each stage of the material life cycle, i.e. from extraction, processing, consumption and recycling to disposal. This analysis informs resource policy, energy planning, environmental and waste management. This paper reports on a historical material flow analysis of the world iron ore and steel industry in which the material flow of iron ore and of crude steel products are quantified for the period from 1950 to 2005. On the basis of this analysis, the future production of iron and steel for the world is estimated. The historical analysis shows that the world iron ore production increased from 274 million tons (Mt) in 1950 to 1554Mt in 2005, whereas the steel production increased from 207 to 1259 Mt. In addition, it is found that at the current level of production the world's identified iron ore reserves containing 230 billion tons of iron would last for nearly 50 years. Global CO2 emissions from steel production from the different manufacturing routes are estimated to be 3169Mt from approximately 1781Mt of steel production by 2020, whereas the specific energy consumption is estimated to be 14.43 GJ/tcs. The analysis of historical production trends of iron ore and crude steel for the major iron ore and steel producing countries indicates that, incidentally, the major iron ore producing countries are not the major steel producing countries and vice-versa. For example, in 2005, Brazil's iron ore production was 322Mt whereas its steel production was approximately 10{\%} of its iron ore production. For the same period, Japan's steel production was 124Mt though; it had no domestic iron ore production. The world flows of iron ore and steel clearly indicate that the weak end of the iron and steel industry is the time, cost and environmental emissions associated with the sea borne transport of materials. Further, a substance flow model for the year 2006 indicating the net flows of iron ore, crude and finished steel products across the continents demonstrates that these flows of materials is not environmentally sustainable, and the iron and steel sector could do a lot to contribute to sustainable development. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

@article{lindner_disaggregating_2012,
abstract = {Disaggregating a sector within the Leontief input–output (IO) framework is not a straightforward task since there is more than one possibility for the unknown technical coefficients of the disaggregated IO table, and more information than what is embodied in the aggregated IO table is thus required. This paper presents a methodology for disaggregating sectors into an arbitrary number of new sectors when the only available information about the newly formed sectors is their output weights. A random walk algorithm is used to explore the polytope containing the admissible combinations for the unknown technical coefficients of the disaggregated IO table. These combinations are then used to construct the probability distribution of the coefficients of the inverse Leontief matrix. The methodology is illustrated by disaggregating the electricity production sector of China's 2007 IO table and by looking at the probability distribution of the CO2 emission intensity factors of the sectors of the economy.},

abstract = {$\backslash$n               It is not uncommon to find literacy figured as “toxic” in discussions of its power to regulate and discipline social behavior. The author's aim in this article is to move from metaphor to material as he explores the toxicity inherent in the manufacturing processes that make print available for mass consumption. He argues that over the past century, the demand for print in certain regions of the United States, primarily the North and West, spurred the growth of commercial papermaking—and the spread of devastating mill pollution—in the South, where demand for print has historically lagged. He suggests that one result of this pollution has been the weakening of social institutions that typically promote and value normative forms of literate activity. With the industries that enable the mass circulation of print now going global, this pattern of uneven and unjust literacy development may well be repeated.$\backslash$n             },

@article{WorldSteelAssociation2015,
abstract = {Despite continued turbulence around the world in 2014, it has been another record year for the steel industry. Crude steel production totalled 1,665 million tonnes (Mt), an increase of 1{\%} compared to 2013. 2014 also saw the emergence of a new phase in steel markets. For the past decade, the steel industry was dominated by events in China. The evidence is that the steel industry is now entering a period of pause before undoubtedly picking up again when markets other than China drive new demand. Nobody can predict exactly when or where. Today, China represents around 48{\%} of the global market for steel. This will decline in years to come. The impact of urbanisation will have a key role to play in the future. It is estimated that a little more than 1 billion people will move to towns and cities between now and 2030. This major flow will create substantial new demand for steel to be used in infrastructure developments such as water, energy and mass transit systems as well as major construction and housing programmes. Steel is a truly innovative material necessary for society to survive and advance. It is adaptable enough to meet existing and future challenges and has evolved to meet the challenges of high speed railway, high rise buildings, the revolution in automobile design, renewable energy and deep sea marine applications.},

@article{Behrens2016,
abstract = {Over the past two decades, many countries have used aggressive policies such as feed-in tariffs and power purchase agreements to promote renewable energy. These policies have been very successful in several countries, initiating large changes in the structure of energy sectors, and conferring large environmental, economic, and social impacts. In this paper, we quantify these impacts over the period 2000-2010 for Portugal; a country that witnessed a substantial increase in renewable energy penetration rates, with the share of wind power in electricity production jumping from 0.4{\%} in 2000 to 16.8{\%} in 2010. We use a novel, hybrid energy-economic input-output model to compare the historical energy policy against a counterfactual scenario in which the surge in energy subsidies and concurrent expansion of renewable energies did not take place. We consider the impact of renewable energy policy stemming from three propagation modes - operational, investment, and opportunity costs - in both the energy sector and the rest of the economy. This is the first time such a comprehensive analysis has been undertaken. Our findings show that, in the period under consideration, the combined historical renewable energy policy and renewable energy developments yielded a clear reduction in emissions, in excess of 7.2 MtCO2eq, an increase in GDP of 1557 M???, and a creation of 160 thousand job-years. These estimates do not include opportunity costs from future FIT payments that projects built in this period may be entitled to. Therefore, this work will be of critical interest to RES-E and climate change policy makers, other scientists, and the public.},

abstract = {In the last few years some studies have been presented, which link land use accounting and input-output analysis (based on monetary input-output tables (MIOTs)) for the calculation of direct and indirect land appropriation of production and consumption activities. The compilation of the first comprehensive physical input-output tables (PIOTs) for some western European countries in the 1990s opened new possibilities for linking physical accounting and input-output analysis. Using a physical multiplier for this kind of calculation is more appropriate, as the most land intensive sectors are also the sectors with the highest amounts of material flows. Physical input-output analysis illustrates land appropriation in relation to material flows of each of the sectors, which is more appropriate from the point of view of environmental pressures than land appropriation in relation to monetary flows of a MIOT. Physical input-output analysis has so far not been applied for any land-related studies. Based on a physical input-output model of the EU-15, physical input-output analysis is applied in this paper, in order to calculate direct and indirect land requirements for the production of exports from EU-15 to the rest of the world. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {LEAD DG – RESPONSIBLE UNIT ENV (A1, A2, A3, F1), GROW DATE OF ROADMAP 04 / 2015 This indicative roadmap is provided for information purposes only and is subject to change. It does not prejudge the final decision of the Commission on whether this initiative will be pursued or on its final content and structure. A. Context and problem definition (1) What is the political context of the initiative? (2) How does it relate to past and possible future initiatives, and to other EU policies? (3) What ex-post analysis of existing policy has been carried out? What results are relevant for this initiative? (1) This initiative is meant as a direct contribution to the objectives pursued to give a new boost for Jobs, Growth and Investment and placed within the wider context of the Commission's commitment towards sustainable development. Moreover, eco-industries and eco-innovation currently supply a third of the global market for green technologies, worth a trillion euro and expected to double by 2020. This initiative aims to reinforce this trend, thus contributing to green growth and to other EU priorities such as the work towards developing a Resilient Energy Union with a Forward-Looking Climate Change Policy. In July 2014, the Commission adopted a Circular Economy Package, including a " chapeau " Communication "Towards a circular economy: a zero waste programme for Europe" 1 , accompanied by communications on sustainable buildings 2 , green employment 3 , SMEs 4 , and a legislative proposal for the review of waste legislation 5 . The latter specifically was in response to the legal obligation to review the targets of three Directives: the Waste Framework Directive (WFD), the Landfill Directive, and the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (PPWD) 6 . In its 2015 Work Programme, the Commission announced the intention to withdraw the 2014 proposal on Waste Review (the withdrawal was finalised on 25/02/2015) and to replace it with a new, more ambitious proposal by end 2015 to promote the circular economy. Two main reasons have motivated this withdrawal. Firstly, the overall approach presented in July 2014 had a rather exclusive focus on waste management, without appropriately exploring synergies with other policies -clear examples of such policies are product policies or the development of well-functioning markets for secondary raw materials. It is therefore important to step up the ambition by looking more concretely at waste management on the one hand, and related key aspects of the value chain, which are essential in order to "close the loop" of the circular economy, on the other hand. Secondly, as far as the waste proposal is concerned, the Commission will examine, in particular, how to make this proposal more country specific, and how to improve the implementation of waste policy on the ground. To that effect, the Commission will look more closely in particular into existing problems of non-compliance which is essential to ensure effective implementation. The new initiative therefore aims to establish a framework to overcome shortcomings and create conditions for the development of a circular economy. This will require a clear and ambitious political vision combined with effective policy tools that can drive real change on the ground. (2) A number of existing policy initiatives are related to the circular economy. They include:},

@techreport{Tukker2006,
abstract = {Being a part of standard national accounts, input-output tables describe the value of transactions between the different sectors in the economy. If such tables are extended coherently to also include environmental information, such as sectoral emissions or resource use, then they have the potential to provide powerful tools for environment-related policy analysis, for example in the areas of integrated product policy and sustainable use of natural resources. The currently available versions of such tables have already proved their value, for example in the JRC-IPTS-led EIPRO (1 ) project, in which they served to identify those products consumed in Europe that have the greatest environmental impact throughout their life cycles. It is also clear however, that for other important applications — for instance, to study the link between the economic output of the EU and the environmental impacts over time — the data situation would have to improve. The availability and quality of environmentally extended input-output tables varies a lot between different European countries, and there are no such tables based on official statistics for the EU as a whole. As a further contribution to developing the knowledge base for the EU thematic strategy on the sustainable use of natural resources and for environmental policies in general, the JRC-IPTS therefore set up a project to explore the full potential of environmentally extended input-output tables and models for Europe and commissioned a study to a consortium of TNO and Leiden University with the aim to show the ways how the required data can be obtained. The results of the study are presented in this report. The report starts with an overview of the input-output tables and environmental extensions available in Europe today and then sketches the principal application areas in modelling and policy analysis. They include identifying the main sources of environmental problems within the economic system, ex-ante impact assessment of environment-relevant policies, as well as informing policy-making at the strategic level about trends in the environmental performance of the economy and their drivers. The report then translates the analytical requirement of such applications into technical specifications for the environmentally extended input-output tables. Finally, it produces a number of alternative roadmaps of how to produce such tables for Europe: an ambitious ‘royal route' which, in the long term, would lead to a data situation that serves the analytical requirements in an ideal manner, and two ‘realistic' options to achieve a reasonably good data situation within a few years. Thus, the information contained in this report is relevant to both providers of statistical information about the environmental performance of the economy and to policy-makers and researchers looking for tools to identify priorities, assess impacts and make strategic goals such as eco-efficiency or decoupling environmental impact from growth operational.},

@article{Ayres2004,
abstract = {There is an attractive analogy between nature and industry, based on the similarity of natural functions and certain industrial activities. For instance, animals ingest (eat) and digest food. Finally, there are metabolic wastes. Firms are analogous to organisms in several respects, insofar as they consume material resources, process (digest) them and produce output products and excrete wastes. Firms, like organisms, also compete with each other for resources. Curiously enough, one of the apparent differences between natural and man-made systems is actually not one; like the industrial system, the natural system does not recycle everything. However, there are at least four real and important differences between the biosphere (ecology) and the technosphere (economy). First, there is no primary producer in the economic system analogous to what photosynthesizers play in the biosphere. Inputs to the economy are mostly natural resources, capital services and labor. Second, in the economic system, output is a heterogeneous mix of manufactured products and services. Labor, in economics, is an input but not an output. The economic system recycles much less than the ecological system but utilizes a far greater suite of elements. In the biosphere, there are no products as such. Growth is tantamount to accumulation of embodied solar exergy in the form of cellulose, sugars, lipids and proteins. The biosphere produces only wastes and more of itself plus dead matter. Third, in the biosphere, there are no markets, there is no medium of exchange (like money) and there is nothing analogous to paid labor. Exchanges are involuntary (i.e., by predation, parasitism or theft.) Fourth, evolution in nature is driven by differentiation by random mutations of the genome and Darwinian selection based on reproductive success. In economics, differentiation is based on discovery, invention and innovation by intelligent economic agents and selection is based on competition at the individual or firm level. Either way, the economic system is not closely analogous to an ecosystem. Attempts to use ecological concepts in an economic context are often misleading and unjustified. The paper discusses the implications of the eco-eco mismatch for resource accounting and life cycle analysis. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

And finally, last years there was the financial crisis that affected a lot of societies. All issues have there affect on the construction sector. Because of those issues there is an urgency to implement principles of the Circular Economy in the construction sector. The concept of the Circular Economy tries to counterpart these issues. Unfortunately, there is no step-by-step plan on how to make a transition towards the Circular Economy. There is a lack of, but also a need for, data, information, and knowledge regarding the Circular Economy within the construction sector.

abstract = {Recently the Circular Economy (CE) concept has gained momentum in the Netherlands, propounding that environmental impact reduction can provide a significant positive economical impulse. The government, larger parts of the industry as a whole, as well as the construction industry, has warmly received this approach. At first sight the CE concept connects over two centuries of sustainability thinking together in a relatively seen rather coherent framework. So, CE in its constituent elements doesn't provide anything new. It is the economic framework uniting the elements, which makes CE a new and challenging approach. Insofar the Dutch construction industry is concerned, based on the extensive experiences of the authors over the past years, the CE concept gets a fragmented, incoherent and eclectic interpretation. In the paper, departing from the concept of the ‘homo-economicus' (Mill, 1836), and the free market theory (Malthus, 1826) CE, is re-defined into ‘Radical CE' attempting to constitute a CE theory and terminology, appropriate for the construction industry and addressing the core of the CE concept in terms of a sustainable industry and society, behaving as such because of economic incentives. Based on the concept of ‘Radical CE', the paper describes and evaluates several CE cases. The paper concludes with some guidelines and strategies for implementing CE.},

The shift to a more sustainable economy, to create wealth with substantially reduced flows of materials and energy, needs new business models. This chapter shows new business models to achieve the EU Lisbon objectives for 2010 – more growth and more jobs – while simultaneously reducing the resource consumption of industrialized countries. The new business models are grouped under the name of the performance economy, there common denominator is that they enable entrepreneurs to achieve a higher competitiveness with greatly reduced resource consumption and without an externalization of the costs of waste and of risk. The change from an industrial to a performance economy is full of opportunities but also obstacles. This chapter summarizes some of the major issues involved in such a shift; many others depend on the economic sector concerned and the national framework conditions in place. It also proposes two new metrics to measure the path towards the sustainability of corporations and to give sustainable investors a reliable guide for historic analysis and future projections.},

abstract = {Vehicle-to-grid power (V2G) uses electric-drive vehicles (battery, fuel cell, or hybrid) to provide power for specific electric markets. This article examines the systems and processes needed to tap energy in vehicles and implement V2G. It quantitatively compares today's light vehicle fleet with the electric power system. The vehicle fleet has 20 times the power capacity, less than one-tenth the utilization, and one-tenth the capital cost per prime mover kW. Conversely, utility generators have 10-50 times longer operating life and lower operating costs per kWh. To tap V2G is to synergistically use these complementary strengths and to reconcile the complementary needs of the driver and grid manager. This article suggests strategies and business models for doing so, and the steps necessary for the implementation of V2G. After the initial high-value, V2G markets saturate and production costs drop, V2G can provide storage for renewable energy generation. Our calculations suggest that V2G could stabilize large-scale (one-half of US electricity) wind power with 3{\%} of the fleet dedicated to regulation for wind, plus 8-38{\%} of the fleet providing operating reserves or storage for wind. Jurisdictions more likely to take the lead in adopting V2G are identified. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Boulding1966,
abstract = {Index Kenneth Boulding The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth (1966) Note This famous paper was presented at the Sixth Resources for the Future Forum on Environmental Quality in a Growing Economy in Washington, D.C. on March 8,1966. It presents an image of the earth as a finite entity that we should cherish and protect instead of using to the utmost. New ideas and perspectives are, however, still slightly mixed with the illusion of a benevolent state, acting in the public interest, whose task is to introduce the adjustments necessary for the transition to the economy of the spaceship earth. We are now in the middle of a long process of transition in the nature of the image which man has of himself and his environment. Primitive men, and to a large extent also men of the early civilizations, imagined themselves to be living on a virtually illimitable plane. There was almost always somewhere beyond the known limits of human habitation, and over a very large part of the time that man has been on earth, there has been something like a frontier. That is, there was always some place else to go when things got too difficult, either by reason of the deterioration of the natural environment or a deterioration of the social structure in places where people happened to live. The image of the frontier is probably one of the oldest images of mankind, and it is not surprising that we find it hard to get rid of. Gradually, however, man has been accustoming himself to the notion of the spherical earth and a closed sphere of human activity. A few unusual spirits among the ancient Greeks perceived that the earth was a sphere. It was only with the circumnavigations and the geographical explorations of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, however, that the fact that the earth was a sphere became at all widely known and accepted. Even in the nineteenth century, the commonest map was Mercator's projection, which visualizes the earth as an illimitable cylinder, essentially a plane wrapped around the globe, and it was not until the Second World War and the development of the air age that the global nature of the planet really entered the popular imagination. Even now we are very far from having made the moral, political, and psychological adjustments which are implied in this transition from the illimitable plane to the closed sphere. Economists in particular, for the most part, have failed to come to grips with the ultimate consequences of the transition from the open to the closed earth. One hesitates to use the terms "open" and "closed" in this connection, as they have been used with so many different shades of meaning. Nevertheless, it is hard to find equivalents. The open system, indeed, has some similarities to the open system of von Bertalanffy 1, in that it implies that some kind of a structure is maintained in the midst of a throughput from inputs to outputs. In a closed system, the outputs of all parts of the system are linked to the inputs of other parts. There are no inputs from outside and no outputs to the outside; indeed, there is no outside at all. Closed systems, in fact, are very rare in human experience, in fact almost by definition unknowable, for if there are genuinely closed systems around us, we have no way of getting information into them or out of them; and hence if they are really closed, we would be quite unaware of their existence. We can only find out about a closed system if we participate in it. Some isolated primitive societies may have approximated to this, but even these had to take inputs from the environment and give outputs to it. All living organisms, including man himself, are open systems. They have to receive inputs in the shape of air, food, water, and give off outputs in the form of effluvia and excrement. Deprivation of input of air, even for a few minutes, is fatal. Deprivation of the ability to obtain any input or to dispose of any output is fatal in a relatively short time. All human societies have likewise been open systems. They receive inputs from the earth, the atmosphere, and the waters, and they give outputs into these reservoirs; they also produce inputs internally in the shape of babies and outputs in the shape of corpses. Given a capacity to draw upon inputs and to get rid of outputs, an open system of this kind can persist indefinitely. There are some systems - such as the biological phenotype, for instance the human body - which cannot maintain themselves indefinitely by inputs and outputs because of the phenomenon of aging. This process is very little understood. It occurs, evidently, because there are some outputs which cannot be replaced by any known input. There is not the same necessity for aging in organizations and in societies, although an analogous phenomenon may take place. The structure and composition of an organization or society, however, can be maintained by inputs of fresh personnel from birth and education as the existing personnel ages and eventually dies. Here we have an interesting example of a system which seems to maintain itself by the self-generation of inputs, and in this sense is moving towards closure. The input of people (that is, babies) is also an output of people (that is, parents). Systems may be open or closed in respect to a number of classes of inputs and outputs. Three important classes are matter, energy, and information. The present world economy is open in regard to all three. We can think of the world economy or "econosphere" as a subset of the "world set," which is the set of all objects of possible discourse in the world. We then think of the state of the econosphere at anyone moment as being the total capital stock, that is, the set of all objects, people, organizations, and so on, which are interesting from the point of view of the system of exchange. This total stock of capital is clearly an open system in the sense that it has inputs and outputs, inputs being production which adds to the capital stock, outputs being consumption which subtracts from it. From a material point of view, we see objects passing from the noneconomic into the economic set in the process of production, and we similarly see products passing out of the economic set as their value becomes zero. Thus we see the econosphere as a material process involving the discovery and mining of fossil fuels, ores, etc., and at the other end a process by which the effluents of the system are passed out into noneconomic reservoirs - for instance, the atmosphere and the oceans - which are not appropriated and do not enter into the exchange system. From the point of view of the energy system, the econosphere involves inputs of available energy in the form, say, of water power, fossil fuels, or sunlight, which are necessary in order to create the material throughput and to move matter from the noneconomic set into the economic set or even out of it again; and energy itself is given off by the system in a less available form, mostly in the form of heat. These inputs of available energy must come either from the sun (the energy supplied by other stars being assumed to be negligible) or it may come from the earth itself, either through its internal heat or through its energy of rotation or other motions, which generate, for instance, the energy of the tides. Agriculture, a few solar machines, and water power use the current available energy income. In advanced societies this is supplemented very extensively by the use of fossil fuels, which represent as it were a capital stock of stored-up sunshine. Because of this capital stock of energy, we have been able to maintain an energy input into the system, particularly over the last two centuries, much larger than we would have been able to do with existing techniques if we had had to rely on the current input of available energy from the sun or the earth itself. This supplementary input, however, is by its very nature exhaustible. The inputs and outputs of information are more subtle and harder to trace, but also represent an open system, related to, but not wholly dependent on, the transformations of matter and energy. By far the larger amount of information and knowledge is self-generated by the human society, though a certain amount of information comes into the sociosphere in the form of light from the universe outside. The information that comes from the universe has certainly affected man's image of himself and of his environment, as we can easily visualize if we suppose that we lived on a planet with a total cloud-cover that kept out all information from the exterior universe. It is only in very recent times, of course, that the information coming in from the universe has been captured and coded into the form of a complex image of what the universe is like outside the earth; but even in primitive times, man's perception of the heavenly bodies has always profoundly affected his image of earth and of himself. It is the information generated within the planet, however, and particularly that generated by man himself, which forms by far the larger part of the information system. We can think of the stock of knowledge, or as Teilhard de Chardin called it, the "noosphere," and consider this as an open system, losing knowledge through aging and death and gaining it through birth and education and the ordinary experience of life. From the human point of view, knowledge or information is by far the most important of the three systems. Matter only acquires significance and only enters the sociosphere or the econosphere insofar as it becomes an object of human knowledge. We can think of capital, indeed, as frozen knowledge or knowledge imposed on the material world in the form of improbable arrangements. A machine, for instance, originated in the mind of man, and both its construction and its use involve information processes imposed on the material world by man himself.

As William McDonough and Michael Braungart argue in their provocative, visionary book, however, this approach perpetuates a one-way, "cradle to grave" manufacturing model that dates to the Industrial Revolution and casts off as much as 90 percent of the materials it uses as waste, much of it toxic. Why not challenge the notion that human industry must inevitably damage the natural world, they ask.In fact, why not take nature itself as our model? A tree produces thousands of blossoms in order to create another tree, yet we do not consider its abundance wasteful but safe, beautiful, and highly effective; hence, "waste equals food" is the first principle the book sets forth. Products might be designed so that, after their useful life, they provide nourishment for something new-either as "biological nutrients" that safely re-enter the environment or as "technical nutrients" that circulate within closed-loop industrial cycles, without being "downcycled" into low-grade uses (as most "recyclables" now are). Elaborating their principles from experience (re)designing everything from carpeting to corporate campuses, the authors make an exciting and viable case for change.},

abstract = {Electric-drive vehicles can provide power to the electric grid when they are parked (vehicle-to-grid power). We evaluated the economic potential of two utility-owned fleets of battery-electric vehicles to provide power for a specific electricity market, regulation, in four US regional regulation services markets. The two battery-electric fleet cases are: (a) 100 Th!nk City vehicle and (b) 252 Toyota RAV4. Important variables are: (a) the market value of regulation services, (b) the power capacity (kW) of the electrical connections and wiring, and (c) the energy capacity (kWh) of the vehicle's battery. With a few exceptions when the annual market value of regulation was low, we find that vehicle-to-grid power for regulation services is profitable across all four markets analyzed. Assuming now more than current Level 2 charging infrastructure (6.6 kW) the annual net profit for the Th!nk City fleet is from US{\$} 7000 to 70,000 providing regulation down only. For the RAV4 fleet the annual net profit ranges from US{\$} 24,000 to 260,000 providing regulation down and up. Vehicle-to-grid power could provide a significant revenue stream that would improve the economics of grid-connected electric-drive vehicles and further encourage their adoption.

abstract = {s self-governance viable in community energy systems? Thus far, scientific literature dealing with self-governance has been largely confined to the analysis of socio-ecological systems. Our contribution, in this paper, lies in the analysis of self-governance in socio-technical systems. We make the hypothesis that an increase in social and technical exigency leads to increased polycentric governance. We explore possible system configurations along these dimensions and assert an important nuance: the viability of self-governance in community energy systems may lie in the communities' abilities to be adaptive to coordinate with different governance circles. In this respect, we point out that self-governance arrangements can take many different forms. We have conceived a taxonomy of the types of self-governance, based on the degrees of social and technical complexity. Some insight is gained to consider the effect technology itself can have upon governance, in reducing technical and social complexity, thereby facilitating self-governance. Local biogas networks, which illustrate our approach, are a category of socio-technical systems for which a self-governance structure might be a feasible and desirable option. - See more at: http://www.edgar-program.com/publications/working-papers/5{\#}sthash.h58zryPw.dpuf},

abstract = {Britain faces huge economic challenges in its use of labour and scarce natural resources. Although unemployment is now falling, the risk of being out of work is higher in some regions and for some types of occupations. While Britain has significantly increased its resource efficiency in recent years, supply risks in an increasingly competitive global economy mean that we need to get better at using natural resources.1 The analysis in this study shows that these challenges are linked, as improving our resource efficiency can make a valuable contribution to improving Britain's labour market situation. One route to improving resource efficiency is to develop what is known as a ‘circular economy'. This involves keeping products and resources in use for as long as possible through recovery, reuse, repair, remanufacturing and recycling.2 In addition to protecting the environment, this potentially offers substantial economic benefits.3 These include greater economic stability through increased resource security and new business and employment opportunities from an expanding sector. This study focuses on the latter aspect and aims to identify the scope for the growth of the circular economy to offer new jobs. Britain is already experiencing significant labour market challenges, such as persistent high unemployment in some regions and declining employment in mid-level occupations. The labour market exhibits significant regional and occupational mismatch, meaning that available employment opportunities are often not well aligned, either with where the unemployed live, or with the experience they have from their previous occupations. Labour market mismatches are thought to account for around three percentage points of the unemployment rate and are likely to have played a significant role in the rise in unemployment since the start of the financial crisis.4},

abstract = {As the light vehicle fleet moves to electric drive (hybrid, battery, and fuel cell vehicles), an opportunity opens for "vehicle-to-grid" (V2G) power. This article defines the three vehicle types that can produce V2G power, and the power markets they can sell into. V2G only makes sense if the vehicle and power market are matched. For example, V2G appears to be unsuitable for baseload power - the constant round-the-clock electricity supply - because baseload power can be provided more cheaply by large generators, as it is today. Rather, V2G's greatest near-term promise is for quick-response, high-value electric services. These quick-response electric services are purchased to balance constant fluctuations in load and to adapt to unexpected equipment failures; they account for 5-10{\%} of electric cost - {\$} 12 billion per year in the US. This article develops equations to calculate the capacity for grid power from three types of electric drive vehicles. These equations are applied to evaluate revenue and costs for these vehicles to supply electricity to three electric markets (peak power, spinning reserves, and regulation). The results suggest that the engineering rationale and economic motivation for V2G power are compelling. The societal advantages of developing V2G include an additional revenue stream for cleaner vehicles, increased stability and reliability of the electric grid, lower electric system costs, and eventually, inexpensive storage and backup for renewable electricity. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {As an alternative to the internal combustion engine, the fuel cell offers the potential for providing transportation services with zero or near-zero pollutant emissions, with large reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and with reduced energy insecurity as a result of being able to use a wide range of feedstocks for fuel as alternatives to oil from politically unstable regions. If the fuel cell comes to replace the internal combustion engine in transportation applications, it could radically transform not just transportation, but stationary power generation as well -- if houses and workplaces were "plugged into" fuel-cell cars when the cars were not being driven. This paper assesses the feasibility of cogenerating electricity and heat for residential and commercial buildings using proton- exchange-membrane (PEM) fuel cells in cars. The performance of fuel-cell car cogeneration systems in residences and workplaces in New Jersey and Texas is investigated using hourly simulation models. Results indicate the concept of fuel-cell car cogeneration is technically and economically plausible and merits consideration as an innovative element in the portfolio of options for the distributed utility of the future.},

abstract = {Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is a technique for systematically analyzing a product from cradle-to-grave, that is, from re- source extraction through manufacture and use to disposal. LCA is a mixed or hybrid analytical system. An inventory phase analyzes system inputs of energy and materials along with outputs of emissions and wastes throughout life cycle, usually as quantitative mass loadings. An impact assessment phase then examines these loadings in light of potential en- vironmental issues using a mixed spectrum of qualitative and quantitative methods.The constraints imposed by inventory's loss of spatial, temporal, dose-response, and threshold infor- mation raise concerns about the accuracy of impact assess- ment.The degree of constraint varies widely according to the environmental issue in question and models used to ex- trapolate the inventory data. LCA results may have limited value in two areas: (I) local and/ortransient biophysical pro- cesses and (2) issues involving biological parameters, such as biodiversity, habitat alteration, and toxicity.The end result is that impact assessment does not measure actual effects or impacts, nor does it calculate the likelihood of an effect or risk Rather, LCA impact assessment results are largely directional environmental indicaton.The accuracy and usefulness of indicators need to be assessed individually and in a cir- cumstance-specific manner prior to decision making.This limits LCAs usefulness as the sole basis for comprehensive assessments and the comparisons of alternatives. In conclu- sion, LCA may identify potential issues from a systemwide perspective, but more-focused assessments using other ana- lytical techniques are often necessary to resolve the issues.},

Meditation is increasingly being used to combat stress, manage pain, relieve anxiety and lift depression, a claim which appears to be backed by research. Aromatherapy, once dismissed as a fad, has come to be widely valued as a cost-effective, useful treatment for a range of conditions including stress and musculoskeletal disorders. Acupuncture is widely offered throughout the UK, with many medical professionals training in acupuncture. Musculoskeletal disorders respond well to acupuncture, which works very well in treating pain, especially if this is picked up while people are still at work.},

abstract = {Resource scarcity has been a topic within literature since the mid of the 20th century. In recent years, this topic has regained attention due to environmental, social and financial problems that our society has to deal with. Now the focus is found in both literature and practice. The Circular Economy is a new paradigm within sustainability that focusses on resource efficiency in support of the environment, social cohesiveness and enables new business opportunities. Research on implementing the Circular Economy concentrates on product design and procurement of consumer goods, clothing and furniture. Liander, a distribution network operator (DNODNO ) based in the Netherlands, has set the aim to become the first circular grid operator. To achieve this they set out several questions. First, how to further develop the concept of Circular Economy, especially in relation to their asset base. And secondly, how to incorporate the Circular Economy and thus sustainability in their business case. The aim is to enable a bottom-up approach for securing sustainability in their business. To implement this, the complexity of this subject is structured into a practical and comprehensible method. Implementing the Circular Economy for assets with long life spans, like those of Liander, has not yet received much attention. To embed the environmental sustainability into the business, tools are required that help to oversee the complexity and to support decision-making. Investment decision methodologies are a tool to gain this required insight and help to choose between the trade-offs. However, investment decision methods that contain sustainability are still scarce within the business case literature. Several scholars have addressed the need for this but also pointed out the problem of the subject's complexity. Hence, this study addresses this problem by structuring environmental sustainability from a Circular Economy perspective. A conceptual model for a sustainable business case has been developed which answers the need to embed environmental sustainability. This model has been translated into a sustainable investment decision aiding (SIDASIDASIDA ) model that aims to make asset investment processes more transparent and comprehensible. This model has been established through the Design Science Methodology based upon literature and a case study at Liander. Distribution transformers were the subject of this case study and acted as a test case to evaluate the model and its application. The case study concerns two investment decision problems: (1) whether a current age limit to replace transformers is defendable, and (2) whether to invest in a technology different from the current standard. Additionally, three other scenarios were tested that influence the life cycle or efficiency of the distribution transformer. The research concludes that environmental sustainability should be included as a separate constituent in the investment decision methodology. This constituent is defined using three indicators: (1) material usage, (2) ecological footprint and (3) environmental impact. Considering the case study, some preliminary conclusions about the sustainability of distribution transformers are drawn. The use of bio-oil to replace mineral oils is expected to have a large impact. As follow up of this study it is recommended to validate the developed model in different sectors with different product characteristics. In addition, various recommendation are given towards for further research, towards Liander and to the government.},

Understanding of the processes that lead to improvements in or deterioration of natural resources is limited, because scientific disciplines use different concepts and languages to describe and explain complex social-ecological systems (SESs). Without a common framework to organize findings, isolated knowledge does not cumulate. Until recently, accepted theory has assumed that resource users will never self-organize to maintain their resources and that governments must impose solutions. Research in multiple disciplines, however, has found that some government policies accelerate resource destruction, whereas some resource users have invested their time and energy to achieve sustainability. A general framework is used to identify 10 subsystem variables that affect the likelihood of self-organization in efforts to achieve a sustainable SES.},

@techreport{Cole2014,
abstract = {Elinor Ostrom's IAD and SES frameworks are both widely used among social scientists. Each framework suffers from significant problems not shared by the other. For instance, the IAD framework pays insufficient attention to important social and, especially, ecological variables that can affect or influence social interactions. The SES framework was designed specifically to resolve that problem, but at the cost of the dynamism inherent in the IAD framework. While the SES is capable of diagnosing social and ecological conditions at a fine level of detail, it cannot explain how various attributes interact to generate outcomes, let alone predict or prescribe changes to social-ecological conditions over time. This purpose of this paper is to remedy both of those problems by simply combining Ostrom's two frameworks in a very intuitive way. Instead of incorporating the IAD framework into the SES framework, which was Ostrom's initial plan, we do the opposite: the first-tier SES variables simply replace the "Biophysical Conditions," "Community Attributes," and "Rules-in-Use" boxes of the IAD framework. By this simple expedient, the IAD framework deals becomes more attuned to institutional and ecological complexity, and the SES framework becomes part of a truly dynamic set of processes. We explicate how the combined IAD-SES framework works, first in the relatively static, hypothetical context of Hardin's pasture, and then in the far more dynamic-historical context of Maine's lobster fishery. That last application shows that the two frameworks, when combined, are far more powerful than either framework on its own. In particular, we can use SES variables along with IAD processes to show how interactions of collective-action situations produce outcomes that effect the SES variables which then condition the next phase, round, period, or set of interactions. More work remains to be done, refining and rationalizing SES variables, and further developing IAD elements (such as "Evaluative Criteria" and relations between formal rules and "rules in use") before the combined IAD-SES framework can be called a truly "New Institutional Analysis of Social-Ecological Systems" (NIASES).},

Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

@book{Baland1996,
abstract = {From the Introduction: "The present work is concerned with the topical issue of natural resource management. It does not deal, however, with broad-spectrum environmental concerns such as protection of wilderness areas (for example, the south pole), air or water pollution, etc., but focuses on local ecosystems. What distinguishes local-level resources from larger ecosystems is that (1) they are susceptible of appropriation by relatively small units (including individuals) and (2) they can lead to rivalry in consumption in so far as yields of these resources are clearly perceived as subtractable. This book thus addresses the question as to how these local or village-level natural resources (as contrasted with global commons) can be most efficiently and equitably managed. In other words, can we find guidelines or sound theoretical principles for an optimal long-term exploitation of local resources (forests, irrigation water, pastures, lakes and rivers, sea areas, etc.)? Disturbing evidence highlighting rapid processes of resource depletion, particularly so in developing countries, has stimulated a lot of theoretical and empirical works during the last decades. Moreover, relevant theoretical tools (such as game theory) have been developed independently of environmental concerns which have potential applications to this field. The present attempt aims essentially at making a pause in order to take stock of the achievements attained so far. We believe this step is necessary in view not only of the considerable body of literature which has accumulated on the subject under concern, but also of the multidisciplinary nature of the works involved. Due to these two characteristics, there are many gaps to be bridged between various strands of thinking or contributions to the field. It is our conviction that the time has come to weave together or to otherwise compare and confront different kinds of works around well- defined questions and hypotheses so as to better structure and assess the available body of knowledge. It is striking that economic theorists ignore most of the results obtained by applied researchers, and therefore remain unable to make a valid judgement on the empirical relevance of their analytical propositions. And, on the other hand, applied researchers often ignore the contribution of theorists and, owing to this lacuna, their formulation of the problem and of the hypotheses being tested tends to be imprecise while the concepts used are not always sufficiently tight or rigorous. The field is very complex, indeed, and that is why, to repeat, it is an urgent task to bring some order and to shed some light on where we stand today, taking a broad view of what has been achieved by scholars belonging to different disciplines. Only then can we make a sound assessment of where we ought to direct our attention in future research efforts."},

@article{Ibrahim2008,
abstract = {Electricity generated from renewable sources, which has shown remarkable growth worldwide, can rarely provide immediate response to demand as these sources do not deliver a regular supply easily adjustable to consumption needs. Thus, the growth of this decentralized production means greater network load stability problems and requires energy storage, generally using lead batteries, as a potential solution. However, lead batteries cannot withstand high cycling rates, nor can they store large amounts of energy in a small volume. That is why other types of storage technologies are being developed and implemented. This has led to the emergence of storage as a crucial element in the management of energy from renewable sources, allowing energy to be released into the grid during peak hours when it is more valuable. The work described in this paper highlights the need to store energy in order to strengthen power networks and maintain load levels. There are various types of storage methods, some of which are already in use, while others are still in development. We have taken a look at the main characteristics of the different electricity storage techniques and their field of application (permanent or portable, long- or short-term storage, maximum power required, etc.). These characteristics will serve to make comparisons in order to determine the most appropriate technique for each type of application. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Wolsink2012,
abstract = {The rapid developing literature on 'smart grids' suggests that these will facilitate 'distributed generation' (DG) preferably from renewable sources. However, the current development of smart (micro)grids with substantial amount of DG ("DisGenMiGrids") suffers from a focus on mere 'technology'. Ongoing problems with deployment of renewable energy have shown that implementation is largely determined by broad social acceptance issues. This smart grid development is very important for further renewables deployment, but again there is a tendency to continue the neglect of social determinants. Most technical studies apply implicit and largely unfounded assumptions about the participation in and contribution of actors to DisGenMiGrid systems. This lack of understanding will have severe consequences: smart grids will not further renewables deployment when there are hardly actors that are willing to become part of them. This review is a first attempt to address the social construction of smart electricity grids. As institutional factors have proved to be the main determinants of acceptance, these will also be crucial for further renewables deployment in micro-grid communities. Elaboration of the institutional character of social acceptance and renewables' innovation calls for an institutional theory approach involving Common Pool Resources management, because these socio-technical systems aim to optimise the exploitation of natural resources. Citizens/consumers and other end-users increasingly have the option to become more self-sufficient by becoming co-producers of electricity. They may optimise the contribution of DG when they cooperate and insert their renewable energy in a cooperative microgrid with mutual delivery. Moreover, the option to include 'distributed storage' capacity (electric vehicles) in these microgrids, enables an increasing share of renewables deployment. However, all these options should be institutionally opened. This requires much self-governance and flexible overall regulation that allows microgrids. The research agenda should focus on how such new systems become institutionally embedded, and how they are socially constructed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The evolution of property rights continues to concern scholars of institutions in particular and of economic development more generally. This study investigates why (and how) group ranch members in Kajiado District, Kenya, supported the subdivision of their collective landholdings into individual, titled units. It also explores the outcomes of this transition to individual rights. An increasing scarcity value of land with population increase and the promise of new income-generating opportunities in the individualized arrangement are important factors motivating group ranch members to support subdivision. In addition, distributional asymmetries that arose out of a failure to enforce internal governance arrangements were important motivators. Difficulties in enforcing livestock quotas resulted in poorer livestock herders bearing the uncompensated costs of collective resource use, while the wealthy herders reaped the benefits. Problems with excluding non-members, particularly the wealthy, well-connected herd owners from neighboring individual ranches increased distributional conflict. Group ranch members saw in subdivision an effective way to eliminate these disadvantages. Distributional concerns were more pronounced during the (inequitable) allocation of land parcels following group ranch subdivision. Individuals and groups shifted between formal-legal and customary institutions as they pressed for the assignment of their preferred property rights, and as they sought to 'equalize' parcel sizes. Power asymmetries between negotiating parties were important for conflict resolution, but where insufficient, state structures provided a more effective avenue for resolution. Viewed over a longer time scale, however, this transformation of property rights is path dependent with actors increasingly seeking exclusive rights in an effort to defend their land claims against threats of appropriation by the state, by Maasai elite, and by non-Maasai. Politics is at the core of institutional change. Vegetation cover does not vary significantly between the management strategies that groups and individuals employ to manage their land after subdividing the group ranch. The relationship between management regime and vegetation structure is complicated by longstanding herd redistribution strategies among extended families and their stock associates. It is also obscured by emerging post-transitional arrangements in which rights are traded through leasing and pasture-sharing agreements.},

Hence, the unit of analysis is widened from sectoral systems of innovation to socio-technical systems. The second contribution is to suggest an analytical distinction between systems, actors involved in them, and the institutions which guide actor's perceptions and activities. Thirdly, the article opens up the black box of institutions, making them an integral part of the analysis. Institutions should not just be used to explain inertia and stability. They can also be used to conceptualise the dynamic interplay between actors and structures. The fourth contribution is to address issues of change from one system to another. The article provides a coherent conceptual multi-level perspective, using insights from sociology, institutional theory and innovation studies.

It is found that for low-loaded catalysts, Rh is significantly more active and selective toward hydrogen formation compared to Ru, Pt and Pd, which show a similar behavior. The catalytic performance of Rh and, particularly, Ru is significantly improved with increasing metal loading, leading to higher ethanol conversions and hydrogen selectivities at given reaction temperatures. The catalytic activity and selectivity of high-loaded Ru catalysts is comparable to that of Rh and, therefore, ruthenium was further investigated as a less costly alternative. It was found that, under certain reaction conditions, the 5{\%} Ru/Al2O3 catalyst is able to completely convert ethanol with selectivities toward hydrogen above 95{\%}, the only byproduct being methane. Long-term tests conducted under severe conditions showed that the catalyst is acceptably stable and could be a good candidate for the production of hydrogen by steam reforming of ethanol for fuel cell applications. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

HOT is motivated primarily by systems from biology and engineering and emphasizes, (i) highly structured, nongeneric, self-dissimilar internal configurations, and (ii) robust yet fragile external behavior. HOT claims these are the most important features of complexity and not accidents of evolution or artifices of engineering design but are inevitably intertwined and mutually reinforcing. In the spirit of this collection, our paper contrasts HOT with alternative perspectives on complexity, drawing on real-world examples and also model systems, particularly those from self-organized criticality.},

Cogeneration is often called combined heat and power (CHP), since most cogeneration systems are used to supply electricity and useful heat. However, the heat energy from electricity production can also be used for cooling and other non-heating purposes, so the term ―cogeneration‖ is more inclusive. Cogeneration is a form of local or distributed generation as heat and power production take place at or near the point of consumption. For the same output of useful energy, cogeneration uses far less fuel than does traditional separate heat and power production, which means lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as fossil fuel use is reduced.},

abstract = {Frameworks play an important role in analyzing social-ecological systems (SES) because they provide shared concepts and variables that enable to compare between and accumulate knowledge across multiple cases. One prominent SES framework focusing on local resource use has been developed by Elinor Ostrom and colleagues. This framework is an extensive multi-tier collection of concepts and variables that have proven to be relevant for explaining outcomes in a large number of cases studies in the context of fishery, water and forestry common-pool resources. The further development of this framework has raised a number of issues related to the formal relationships between the large number of concepts and variables involved. In particular, issues related to criteria for ordering the concepts into tiers and adding new concepts, defining outcomes metrics and representing dynamics in the framework have been identified. This paper addresses these issues by applying methods from research fields that study formal relationships between concepts such as domain specific languages, knowledge representation, and software engineering. We find that SES frameworks may include the following seven formal components: variables, concepts, attribution relationships, subsumption relationships, process relationships, aggregation relationships, and evaluation metrics. Applying these components to the Ostrom framework and a case study of recreational fishery, we find that they provide clear criteria for structuring concepts into tiers, defining outcome metrics and representing dynamics. The components identified are generic and the insights gained from this exercise may also be beneficial for the development of other SES frameworks. Keywords:},

abstract = {The security of energy supply to the EU is examined in the context of two storylines. Markets and Institutions exemplifies an economically and politically integrated, multilateral world with effective institutions and markets. Regions and Empires involves a world broken up in rival political and economic blocks, competing for resources and markets via political, economic and military power. It is shown that these storylines have a significant impact on the development of the energy market, on the way in which energy supply may be secured and on the effect and applicability of the several types of instruments available. The current EU is geared towards enlargement and a deepening of economic integration, based on the tenets of the post-1945 multilateral world system. The present world tends towards Regions and Empires and suggests that the EU may have to reorient its energy security policy. Energy policy must become an integral part of EU external trade and foreign relations and security policy. The EU should develop its own strategy, actively investing in dialogues with producer countries in the Persian Gulf and Africa and with Russia. Sustainable prosperity and governance in these regions will support EU energy security. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Quinn2007,
abstract = {This paper analyses the role of institutions in the management of common pool resources (CPRs) in semi-arid Tanzania. Common property regimes have often been considered inadequate for the management of CPRs because of the problems of excludability, but they are becoming more widely supported as the way forward to overcome the problems of resource use and degradation in developing countries. A series of design principles for long enduring common property institutions have been proposed by Ostrom, but there is concern that they are not applicable to a wide range of real life situations or that they may be specific to certain types of CPR. Here, we compare these principles to the situation prevailing in 12 villages in six districts in semi-arid Tanzania. Data on management institutions were collected through semi-structured interviews and meetings at district and village level. The combined information was used to make a qualitative assessment of the strength with which each design principle appeared to operate in the management of forest, pasture and water resources. Boundaries, conflict and negotiation in CPR management are of key importance in semi-arid regions. However, the need for flexibility in order to deal with ecological uncertainty means that many management institutions would be considered weak or absent according to the design principle approach. This supports the view that the design principles should not be used as a 'blueprint to be imposed on resource management regimes' rather that they provide a framework for investigating common property regimes with the proviso that, certainly for semi-arid regions, they may highlight where management cannot be explained by institutional theory alone. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Unstable metabolites formed during the reduction of nitrofurazone by preparations containing reductases IIa and IIb produce breaks in DNA in vitro. In vivo experiments with nitrofurazone-resistant strains, which lack reductase II but contain reductases IIa and IIb, demonstrated that lethality, mutation, and DNA breakage are all greatly increased when cultures are incubated under anaerobic conditions, i.e., conditions such that reductase II is active. These results provide further evidence for the importance of reductive activation of nitrofurazone.},

Using three of the more comprehensive such studies, and with an extensive review of writings on the commons, this paper demonstrates that the enterprise of generating lists of conditions under which commons are governed sustainably is a flawed and impossibly costly research task. For a way out, the paper examines the relative merits of statistical, comparative, and case study approaches to studying the commons. It ends with a plea for careful research design and sample selection, construction of causal mechanisms, and a shift toward comparative and statistical rather than single-case analyses. Such steps are necessary for a coherent, empirically-relevant theory of the commons. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {In research in cardiac development it is unavoidable to use sections of biological tissue, it is difficult to interpret these sections because of the complexity of the developing heart. 3D computer reconstructions can provide an anatomical context of such sections and make their interpretation easier. However, for practical reasons, researchers often do not stain a complete series of sections and, therefore, cannot make a 3D reconstruction. We are developing a program for tracing the anatomical context of individual tissue sections, by automatically fitting 2D sections into 3D reference reconstructions and thus enabling the retrieval of their right location and orientation. In this paper we show that a basic version of the program, using a primarily brute force pixel-based approach, already gives promising results. The performance of this basic program can substantially be improved if the program is extended with the use of relatively simple image features.},

Community energy initiatives might involve only those citizens who prefer to be actively and continuously involved in intense, democratic debate. A more robust conceptualization of community energy might, on the other hand, be guided by Benjamin's Barber's notion of “strong democracy” where community energy initiatives would draw upon a much broader citizen base, involving people from many walks of life and from quarters not generally presumed to be part of a sustained democratic process. The history of community energy is explored and a number of case studies are presented in order to illustrate the problems, prospects and limitations of a socially and technologically decentralized energy system.},

abstract = {Electric-drive vehicles, whether fueled by batteries or by liquid or gaseous fuels generating electricity on-board, will have value to electric utilities as power resources. The power capacity of the current internal combustion passenger vehicle fleet is enormous and under-utilized. In the United States, for example, the vehicle fleet has over 10 times the mechanical power of all current U.S. electrical generating plants and is idle over 95{\%} of the day. Electric utilities could use battery vehicles as storage, or fuel cell and hybrid vehicles as generation. This paper analyzes vehicle battery storage in greatest detail, comparing three electric vehicle configurations over a range of driving requirements and electric utility demand conditions. Even when making unfavorable assumptions about the cost and lifetime of batteries, over a wide range of conditions the value to the utility of tapping vehicle electrical storage exceeds the cost of the two-way hook-up and reduced vehicle battery life. For example, even a currently-available electric vehicle, in a utility with medium value of peak power, could provide power at a net present cost to the vehicle owner of {\$}955 and net present value to the utility of {\$}2370. As an incentive to the vehicle owner, the utility might offer a vehicle purchase subsidy, lower electric rates, or purchase and maintenance of successive vehicle batteries. For a utility tapping vehicle power, the increased storage would provide system benefits such as reliability and lower costs, and would later facilitate large-scale integration of intermittent-renewable energy resources.

Understanding of the processes that lead to improvements in or deterioration of natural resources is limited, because scientific disciplines use different concepts and languages to describe and explain complex social-ecological systems (SESs). Without a common framework to organize findings, isolated knowledge does not cumulate. Until recently, accepted theory has assumed that resource users will never self-organize to maintain their resources and that governments must impose solutions. Research in multiple disciplines, however, has found that some government policies accelerate resource destruction, whereas some resource users have invested their time and energy to achieve sustainability. A general framework is used to identify 10 subsystem variables that affect the likelihood of self-organization in efforts to achieve a sustainable SES.},

We investigate what is happening at the local community level towards realizing these ambitions from a social perspective. We use the case study approach to answer the following question: how do local community energy initiatives contribute to a decentralized sustainable energy system? We find that especially the development of a shared vision, the level of activities and the type of organisation are important factors of the strength of the 'local network'.},

There have been research on the integration of these technologies, but a microgrid with fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) have hardly been studied at the moment in spite of the several technical advantages of FCVs as generating units. This paper therefore presents the mathematical model of a microgrid which includes FCVs, on-site hydrogen stations, solar photovoltaic systems and a wind turbine. The optimal scheduling of hydrogen production, hydrogen refueling to FCVs and electricity supply from FCVs which minimizes the power imported from the main grid is obtained by solving a mixed integer linear programming problem. The computation results of a test case indicate that the model can be used for identifying a bottleneck in the energy flow of a microgrid. The presented model can be extended by including important factors to consider for further research on the integration of microgrids and FCVs.},

A technology-focused literature on sociotechnical transitions shares some of the complex adaptive systems sensibilities of social-ecological systems research. It is considered by others to provide a bridging opportunity to share lessons concerning the governance of both. We contend that lessons must not be restricted to advocacy of flexible, learning-oriented approaches, but must also be open to the critical challenges that confront these approaches. Here, we focus on the critical lessons arising from reactions to a transition management approach to governing transitions to sustainable socio-technical regimes. Moreover, we suggest it is important to bear in mind the different problems each literature addresses, and be cautious about transposing lessons between the two. Nevertheless, questions for transition management about who governs, whose system framings count, and whose sustainability gets prioritised are pertinent to social-ecological systems research. They suggest an agenda that explores critically the kinds of resilience that are helpful or unhelpful, and for whom, and with what social purposes in mind.},

The central features of technological systems are economic competence (the ability to develop and exploit new business oppor- tunities), clustering of resources, and institutional infrastructure. A technological system is defined as a dynamic network of agents interacting in a specific eco- nomic/industrial area under a particular institutional infrastructure and involved in the generation, diffusion, and utilization of technology. Technological systems are defined in terms of knowledge/competence flows rather than flows of ordi- nary goods and services.

This is a remarkable thing, since LCA in practice deals with thousands of quantitative data items that have to be combined in the correct manner. For this, one needs mathematical rules and algorithmic principles for carrying out an LCA. This book presents the first coherent treatment of the mathematical and algorithmic aspects of LCA. These computational aspects are presented in matrix form, so that a concise and elegant formulation is achieved. This form, moreover, provides a platform for further extension of analysis using perturbation theory, structural theory and economic input-output analysis.},

abstract = {The production of activated carbon from coconut shell treated with phosphoric acid (H3PO4) was optimized using the response surface methodology (RSM). Fifteen combinations of the three variables namely; impregnation ratio (1, 1.5, and 2); activation time (10, 20, and 30 min); and activation temperature (400, 450, and 500 ??C) were optimized based on the responses evaluated (yield, bulk density, average pore diameter, small pore diameter, and number of pores in a unit area). Pore diameters were directly measured from scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. Individual second-order response surface models were developed and contour plots were generated for the optimization analysis. The optimum range identified for impregnation ratio was from 1.345 to 2, while for the activation time was from 14.9 to 23.9 min. For the activation temperature it was from 394 to 416 ??C. The optimum points are 1.725, 19.5 min, and 416 ??C, respectively. The models were able to predict well the values of the responses when the optimum variable parameters were validated as proven by the generally acceptable values of the residual percentages. Direct characterization of the pores using the SEM was found to be a good technique to actually see the pores and get actual measurements. Additionally, RSM has also proven to be a good tool in optimization analysis to get not only optimum production condition points but ranges, which are crucial for the flexibility of the production process, as well. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A feasibility study has been carried out on the preliminary process design of the production of activated carbon from the bamboo scaffolding waste based on 30tonnes of bamboo waste per day throughput. A comparison of the process economics of the stand-alone bamboo carbonization plant with a plant that is integrated into another major processing facility has been studied. The preliminary process design was based on various literature sources and an economic evaluation, in which the total capital investment (TCI), the production cost, the return on investment (ROI), the cash flow and the internal rate of return (IRR) of the stand-alone plant and integrated plant were estimated. The TCI of the stand-alone plant and integrated plant are HK{\$} 7,430,000 and HK{\$} 6,430,000, respectively. Net present values of two plants at various discount factors have been determined and the IRR have been estimated as 13.0 and 20.1{\%} for the stand-alone plant and integrated plant, respectively. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the cash flow of the project would be increased or decreased up to 40, 65 and 120{\%} by varying production factors of cost of chemical activation agent, production capacity and selling price of activated carbon, respectively, in the extent of ±25{\%}.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the past, present and future of backcasting. After having reviewed the origin and developments since the 1970s, it is concluded that several varieties can be distinguished and that a shift has been made to broad stakeholder participation and towards a focus on realising follow-up and implementation. A methodological framework for participatory backcasting is proposed consisting of five stages and four groups of tools and methods that can be applied and are necessary in such a framework, while different type of goals are possible. The paper reports on two cases in which participatory backcasting was applied, the Novel Protein Foods project at the Sustainable Technology Programme in the Netherlands and the Nutrition case study of the Sustainable Households (SusHouse) project. The paper concludes that these have resulted in broad stakeholder involvement, sustainable future visions, analyses and construction of follow-up agendas, but that follow-up and impacts are quite different. A research agenda is proposed to compare and evaluate backcasting studies and their impacts after a couple of years, while the future of participatory backcasting is also briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Berghage2007,
abstract = {Green roofs are becoming increasingly common in North America, where they are being promoted as a stormwater management BMP. Although green roofs have been used in Europe, particularly Germany for over 30 years, the North American Industry is still relatively new and installation, management, and performance standards are relatively poorly developed. Research on the performance of North American green roofs has really only been done for the last decade, and although much has been learned, there are still many unanswered questions. There is ample evidence that green roofs can reduce stormwater runoff in Eastern North America by 40 – 60{\%}, but the relative contribution of the media and plants to this stormwater retention has not been characterized or quantified. Further, for this retention and evapotranspiration to be of use to stormwater engineers and developers, tools to predict the retention and detention of stormwater on a green roof are needed. This project describes studies of the evaporation and evapostranspiration of water from green roof modules planted with three common green roof plant species. Green roof plants like sedum and delosperma used water quickly when it was available and reduced their water use rate when they were drought stressed. This makes sedums and delosperma ideal plants for green roof use. Plants contribute as much as 40{\%} of the roof capacity to retain stormwater depending on the frequency and intensity of the storm events. This data and other runoff data from larger field study roofs provided the basis for models that describe and predict the function of a green roof described in this report. In addition to influencing the quantity of runoff, green roofs can also influence the quality of runoff. One of the most consistently reported benefits of a green roof for runoff quality is the neutralization of acid precipitation. It is clear however, that this is a finite property of the medium, controlled by the potential buffering capacity of the medium. To maintain this capacity and hence the water quality benefit, green roof maintenance should include periodic liming to replace the neutralized media buffer. This project describes the buffer potential of two commercial green roof media, and details a testing procedure. The testing procedure allows a green roof manager to estimate when lime will be needed, and what the potential buffering capacity of a green roof media will be. With the two media evaluated there were slight differences in total buffer potential, however the differences were not great and the response to acid addition was similar for both media, with both having sufficient buffering capacity to neutralize acid precipitation in Central Pennsylvania for at least 10 years before liming would be required.},

abstract = {The work presented in this book was carried out within the framework of the Back Casting programme,1 financed through NWO2 and SenterNovem's Energy Research Programme. The Back Casting programme focuses on improving the `back casting' method and on applying thismethod to the case(s) of sustainable energy technologies within the domain of automotive fuels. Back casting can be seen as determining desired future images and describing pathways - i.e., technological trajectories - in order to realise these images. A back casting approach coversdifferent future images and therefore different technological trajectories. With respect tosustainable energy technologies, these trajectories involve a fundamental restructuring of (parts of) our current energy system, involving numerous innovation processes, not just with respect to technologies but also to firms, governments, networks, laws, policies, visions and expectations. This book provides theoretical insights that help identify the opportunities and bottlenecksrelated to such trajectories. It does this by developing a `model of innovation' based on ideas from evolutionary economics and extensive research on historical technological trajectories. This Succession Model of Innovation focuses on the dynamics of emerging ustainable energy systems and thereby provides strategic insights of use to policy makers and other practitioners that aspire to understand and influence emerging sustainable energy technologies in this field. Besides the work presented in this book, the Back Casting programme involved two other projects. While this project (B) focuses on the `socio-technical' dynamics that may induce or hamper the successful unfolding of historical trajectories, another project (A) focuses on the technical design properties and the techno-economical features of possible trajectories of the future. A third project (C) aims to combine insights from both project A and B and to set up actual back casting scenarios. The Back Casting programme was carried out at the Department of Innovation and Environmental Sciences (Project B and C) and at the Department of Science, Technology and Society (Project A). Both are part of the Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development and Innovation at Utrecht University.},

abstract = {A role for green niches has risen to prominence in the environment and innovation literature. The role of idealistic enthusiasts in the creation of sustainability initiatives in niches is widely recognized. The importance of tensions in incumbent socio-technical regimes is acknowledged to provide niches with development opportunities. However, the literature currently gives insufficient consideration to the processes by which niches and regimes interact and are interdependent. This paper addresses this by considering socio-technical translations between niches and regimes. It does so by analysing niche-regime interactions in the areas of food and housing and the development of eco-housing and organic food in the UK. Three kinds of translations are identified that affect the sustainabilities practiced in niches and regimes, and which do not all flow from green niche to incumbent regime.},

Towards this end, the paper first develops industrial ecology as a novel state of the industrial production socio-technical system paying particular attention at its technological component, then it discusses in detail the transition of this system through SNM, and examines whether existing implementations of the industrial ecology (industrial ecosystems and eco-industrial parks) are efforts embracing this philosophy and transition procedures.

Here, we report the one-pot combination of alcohol dehydrogenase-catalysed asymmetric reduction of 2-azido ketones and Pd nanoparticle-catalysed hydrogenation of the resulting azido alcohols, which gives access to both enantiomers of aromatic 1,2-amino alcohols in high yields and excellent optical purity (ee {\textgreater}99{\%}). Furthermore, we demonstrate the incorporation of an upstream azidolysis and a downstream acylation step into the one-pot system, thus establishing a highly integrated synthesis of the antiviral natural product (S)-tembamide in 73{\%} yield (ee {\textgreater}99{\%}) over 4 steps. Avoiding the purification and isolation of intermediates in this synthetic sequence leads to an unprecedentedly low ecological footprint, as quantified by the E-factor and solvent demand.},

abstract = {A bounded socio-technical experiment (BSTE) attempts to introduce a new technology, service, or a social arrangement on a small scale. Many such experiments in personal mobility are ongoing worldwide. They are carried out by coalitions of diverse actors, and are driven by long term and large scale visions of advancing society's sustainability agenda. This paper focuses on the processes of higher-order learning that occur through BSTEs. Based on the conceptual frameworks from theories of organizational learning, policy-oriented learning, and diffusion of innovation, we identify two types of learning: the first type occurs among the participants in the experiment and their immediate professional networks; the second type occurs in the society at large. Both types play a key role in the societal transition towards sustainable mobility systems. Two case studies, in which the Design for Sustainability Group at Technical University of Delft has participated, provide empirical data for the analysis. One case consists of development of a three-wheeled bike-plus vehicle (Mitka); the second case seeks to solve mobility problems on the Dutch island of Texel. We find that higher order learning of the first type occurs among the BSTE participants and beyond. Learning can be facilitated by deployment of structured visioning exercises, by diffusion of ideas among related BSTEs, by innovative couplings of problems and solutions, and by creating links among related experiments. Government agencies, universities and other intellectual entrepreneurs have key roles to play in making that happen. The cases provide much less insights about the second type of learning. Research on the latter is necessary.},

abstract = {The central idea of this paper is that innovation systems are a very important determinant of technological change. We describe that the emergence of a new innovation system and changes in existing innovation systems co-evolve with the process of technological change. Therefore, it is necessary to create more insight in the dynamics of innovation systems. Traditional methods of innovation system analysis that mainly focus on the structure of innovation systems have proven to be insufficient. Therefore, we propose a framework that focuses on a number of processes that are highly important for well performing innovation systems. These processes are labeled as 'functions of innovation systems'. After explaining this framework and embedding it in existing literature, we propose a method for systematically mapping those processes taking place in innovation systems and resulting in technological change. This method can be characterized as a process analysis or history event analysis. Clarifying examples are taken from the empirical field of Sustainable Technology Development. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

First, it uses criticisms on the multi-level perspective as stepping stones for further conceptual refinements. Second, it develops a typology of four transition pathways: transformation, reconfiguration, technological substitution, and de-alignment and re-alignment. These pathways differ in combinations of timing and nature of multi-level interactions. They are illustrated with historical examples. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Differentiated transition contexts determine the form and direction of regime change in response to these pressures. The articulation of pressures, and the degree to which responses are coordinated and based on resources available within the regime, define the transition context. Four alternative contexts are described: endogenous renewal; re-orientation of trajectories; emergent transformation and purposive transitions.

abstract = {Building activity is currently demanding remarkable amounts of inert materials (such as gravel and sand) that are usually provided by alluvial sediments. The EU directives and Italian Legislation are encouraging the re-use of construction and demolition waste provided by continuous urban redevelopment. The re-utilisation of building waste is a relatively new issue for Italy: unfortunately the employment of recycled inert materials is still limited to general bulk and drainage fills, while a more complete re-evaluation is generally hampered by the lack of suitable recycling plants. In this paper, chemical-mineralogical characterization of recycled inert materials was carried out after preliminary crushing and grain-size sorting. XRF and XRD analysis of the different grain-size classes allowed us to recognise particular granulometric classes that can be re-utilised as first-order material in the building activity. Specifically, the presented chemical-mineralogical appraisal indicates that the recycled grain-size fraction 0.6-0.125 mm could be directly re-employed in the preparation of new mortar and concrete, while finer fractions could be considered as components for industrial processing in the preparation of cements and bricks/tiles. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Like in many Small Island Developing States, the techno-economic potential of renewable energy technologies (RETs) in the Maldives is substantial. However, it is not certain that these economically viable RETs will indeed be implemented and utilized, since this is greatly influenced by various social, institutional and political factors (i.e., the Innovation System). In order to steer away from activities that enhance the current fossil fuel based lock-in situation and create an environment that increases the chance of a successful transfer and diffusion of RETs, several projects have been set up in the Maldives. These projects have been initiated by the Global Environmental Facility, the United Nations Development Program, and the European Commission. In this article we evaluate these projects by analyzing whether or not they strengthen the local Renewable Energy Innovation System. This evaluation shows that these RE programs strengthen most of the key processes necessary in an Innovation System conducive to technology transfer. However, as not enough attention is being paid to local entrepreneurial activities and the creation of a domestic market for RETs, the process of RET transfer might run the risk of stagnation after completion of the RE programs. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper investigates the development and diffusion of photovoltaic (PV) technology in Japan and The Netherlands. Both cases are analysed with the Technological Innovation Systems (TIS) framework, which focuses on a particular technology and includes all those factors that influence the development and diffusion of a technology. This framework proposes seven System Functions: key processes that need to be fulfilled for a TIS to function well. We include international factors in the framework such as import share, export activities, foreign direct investment and international knowledge exchange. Japan is found to have a well functioning PV TIS with a strong industry and a large market for PV, whereas the Dutch have so far established considerably less. Based on the differences in the cases we formulate a number of lessons for the Dutch PV TIS. 1) System functions such as guidance of the search (F4) and advocacy coalitions (F7) need to be strengthened in order to reinforce each other in a positive way; 2) formulate, maintain and translate consistent long-term goals into long-term policies and stimulation measures in order to allow a gradual build-up of networks and skills/expertise; 3) build up and maintain legitimacy within the institutional setting; and 4) strengthen the TIS in order for the SMEs to grow in terms of capital and capabilities. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TT are defined as major, long-term technological changes in the way societal functions are fulfilled. TT do not only involve changes in technology, but also changes in user practices, regulation, industrial networks, infrastructure, and symbolic meaning or culture. This paper practices ‘appreciative theory' [R.R. Nelson, S.G. Winter, An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change, Bellknap Press, Cambridge, MA, 1982] and brings together insights from evolutionary economics and technology studies. This results in a multi-level perspective on TT where two views of the evolution are combined: (i) evolution as a process of variation, selection and retention, (ii) evolution as a process of unfolding and reconfiguration. The perspective is empirically illustrated with a qualitative longitudinal case-study, the transition from sailing ships to steamships, 1780–1900. Three particular mechanisms in TT are described: niche-cumulation, technological add-on and hybridisation, riding along with market growth.},

The plant is widely seen to have potential to help combat the greenhouse effect, help to stop local soil erosion, create additional income for the rural poor, and provide a major source of energy both locally and internationally. The principal analytic tool is Strategic Niche Management (SNM), an approach rooted in evolutionary innovation theory. We analyse how the scope for an energy transition is influenced by factors at three societal levels: the overarching 'landscape'; the sectoral setting or 'regime'; and the 'niche' level where the innovation develops and diffuses. Valuable niche processes were found in a few areas, especially in cultivation, but we conclude that there are still many obstacles in Tanzania's prevailing energy regime. The development of Jatropha biofuels is still in an early phase. We list policy recommendations and discuss some methodological issues arising from the use of SNM. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The quality of recycled aggregates from construction and demolition waste (CDW) is strictly related to the content of porous and low strength phases, and specifically to the patches of cement that remain attached to the surface of natural aggregates. This phase increases water absorption and compromises the consistency and strength of concrete made from recycled aggregates. Mineral processing has been applied to CDW recycling to remove the patches of adhered cement paste on coarse recycled aggregates. The recycled fine fraction is usually disregarded due to its high content of porous phases despite representing around 50{\%} of the total waste. This paper focus on laboratory mineral separability studies for removing particles with a high content of cement paste from natural fine aggregate particles (quartz/feldspars). The procedure achieved processing of CDW by tertiary impact crushing to produce sand, followed by sieving and density and magnetic separability studies. The attained results confirmed that both methods were effective in reducing cement paste content and producing significant mass recovery (80{\%} for density concentration and 60{\%} for magnetic separation). The production of recycled sand contributes to the sustainability of the construction environment by reducing both the consumption of raw materials and disposal of CDW, particularly in large Brazilian centers with a low quantity of sand and increasing costs of this material due to long transportation distances. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The properties of recycled aggregate produced from mixed (masonry and concrete) construction and demolition (CD) waste are highly variable, and this restricts the use of such aggregate in structural concrete production. The development of classification techniques capable of reducing this variability is instrumental for quality control purposes and the production of high quality CD aggregate. This paper investigates how the classification of CD mixed coarse aggregate according to porosity influences the mechanical performance of concrete. Concretes using a variety of CD aggregate porosity classes and different water/cement ratios were produced and the mechanical properties measured. For concretes produced with constant volume fractions of water, cement, natural sand and coarse aggregate from recycled mixed CD waste, the compressive strength and Young modulus are direct exponential functions of the aggregate porosity. Sink and float technique is a simple laboratory density separation tool that facilitates the separation of cement particles with lower porosity, a difficult task when done only by visual sorting. For this experiment, separation using a 2.2 kg/dm3 suspension produced recycled aggregate (porosity less than 17{\%}) which yielded good performance in concrete production. Industrial gravity separators may lead to the production of high quality recycled aggregate from mixed CD waste for structural concrete applications. 2009 RILEM.},

abstract = {An analytical framework is developed in this paper in order to explore the diversity of eco-innovations according to several key dimensions (design, user, product service and governance). The framework is used to analyse a set of case studies of eco-innnovation processes. The diversity of the analysed eco-innovations appears to be considerable; each of them involves different kinds of combinations of elements pertaining to those dimensions. Albeit the design dimension is decisive to determine the environmental impacts of the innovation, all dimensions can play a significant role in the management of eco-innovation. Our findings suggest that the capacity of eco-innovations to provide new business opportunities and contribute to the transformation towards a sustainable society depends on the interplay of those dimensions and the engagement of key stakeholders in the innovation process. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper assesses a construction and demonstration (C{\&}D) waste recycling program in relation to technical, institutional, and economic considerations. The focus is primarily placed on a feasibility study for a new mechanical sorting process that was installed with several unit operations, including bar screening, trommel screening, air classifier, disk screening, and final manual sorting. Lab analyses, consisting of sieve analysis, LA abrasion test, friability test, organic content test, and fineness test, with respect to three types of product streams (A, B, and C) were conducted in accordance with selected physical and chemical properties. Findings clearly indicate that the reuse of fine particle generated in product stream A as construction materials in roadbed is highly recommended if the impurities can be removed beforehand. The product stream B could be suitable for reusing as the covering materials in daily operation of sanitary landfills. Yet it could also be used as backfill materials in the construction projects if the impurities can be removed in advance. Only does the LA abrasion test support the reuse of product stream C as coarse aggregate or pavement subbase for those new structures. Once the secondary materials market is stable and the institution settings are sufficient, it is worthwhile addressing that the associated cost-benefit analysis does confirm the economic potential for such a management practice. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The fact is that both of these goals can be achieved at the same time. Although construction and demolition (C{\&}D) constitutes a major source of waste in terms of volume and weight, its management and recycling efforts have not yet seen the light in Kuwait. This study focuses on recycling efforts leading to the minimization of the total C{\&}D waste that is currently landfilled in Kuwait. This paper presents the current status of C{\&}D waste disposal system in Kuwait and identifies the potential problems to the environment, people and economy. Then, it investigates alternative solutions to manage and control this major type of waste in an economically efficient and environmentally safe manner. Next, the paper describes the feasibility of establishing a C{\&}D waste recycling facility in Kuwait. It concludes by highlighting the major benefits and bottleneck problems with such a recycling facility. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Our analytical framework consists of a combination of the socio-technical systems approach, which points at the importance of the openings that must be present at both the niche level: the regime level and the landscape level, for an innovation to be successful, and the innovation system approach. From this latter approach, we use the insight of functions that an innovation system needs to fulfil to be successful: entrepreneurial activities, knowledge development, knowledge diffusion, guidance of the search, market formation, resources mobilisation and support from advocacy coalitions. The socio-technical system viewpoint reveals the importance of explanatory factors outside the wind power innovation system. The function approach points at detailed explanatory factors within the wind power innovation system. We end with a discussion on our analytical framework and policy recommendations.

abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) coupled with low-carbon electricity sources offer the potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and exposure to tailpipe emissions from personal transportation. In considering these benefits, it is important to address concerns of problem-shifting. In addition, while many studies have focused on the use phase in comparing transportation options, vehicle production is also significant when comparing conventional and EVs. We develop and provide a transparent life cycle inventory of conventional and electric vehicles and apply our inventory to assess conventional and EVs over a range of impact categories. We find that EVs powered by the present European electricity mix offer a 10{\%} to 24{\%} decrease in global warming potential (GWP) relative to conventional diesel or gasoline vehicles assuming lifetimes of 150,000 km. However, EVs exhibit the potential for significant increases in human toxicity, freshwater eco-toxicity, freshwater eutrophication, and metal depletion impacts, largely emanating from the vehicle supply chain. Results are sensitive to assumptions regarding electricity source, use phase energy consumption, vehicle lifetime, and battery replacement schedules. Because production impacts are more significant for EVs than conventional vehicles, assuming a vehicle lifetime of 200,000 km exaggerates the GWP benefits of EVs to 27{\%} to 29{\%} relative to gasoline vehicles or 17{\%} to 20{\%} relative to diesel. An assumption of 100,000 km decreases the benefit of EVs to 9{\%} to 14{\%} with respect to gasoline vehicles and results in impacts indistinguishable from those of a diesel vehicle. Improving the environmental profile of EVs requires engagement around reducing vehicle production supply chain impacts and promoting clean electricity sources in decision making regarding electricity infrastructure.},

abstract = {Large scale implementation of solar and wind powered renewable electricity generation will use up to continent sized connected electricity grids built to distribute the locally fluctuating power. Systematic power output variation will then become manifest since solar power has an evident diurnal period, but also surface winds—which are driven by surface temperatures—follow a diurnal periodic behavior lagging about 4 h in time. On an ordinary day a strong diurnal varying renewable electricity generation results when combining wind and solar power on such continent sized grid. Comparison with possible demand patterns indicates that coping with such systematically varying generation will require large scale renewable energy storage and conversion for timescales and storage capacities of at least up to half a day. Seasonal timescales for versatile, high quality, generally applicable, energy conversion and storage are equally essential since the continent wide insolation varies a factor ∼3, e.g., in Europe and Northern Africa together. A first order model for estimating required energy storage and conversion magnitudes is presented, taking into account potential diurnal and seasonal energy demand and generation patterns. A few scalable energy storage methods are briefly indicated.},

abstract = {Historically, societies have been abandoned when management invoked complicated infrastructure that diminished returns on effort. Some societies survived by redefining their relationship to the resource base through emergence of a new, more elaborate level of organization. Organization may elaborate when resources are expanded or used more efficiently. The new situation favorably resets the cost/benefit ratio of problem solving. With six billion people, our critical problem is the capture of natural resources while maintaining ecosystem function to keep them renewable. Presently resource management is too complicated at too low a level, and suffers diminishing returns. Supply-side sustainability recommends management from the context for the function of the whole ecosystem, not the resource. Then ecosystems integrate materials and energy sustainability, while generating resources that humans can take. To achieve a global level of organization of resource management we see a new relationship between the feedback of commerce, greened by the social and environmental resource sciences in the academy, with governmental catalysis.},

abstract = {Using energy more efficiently is a key strategy for reducing global carbon dioxide emissions. Due to limitations on time and resources, actions must be focused on the efficiency measures which will deliver the largest gains. Current surveys of energy efficiency measures assess only known technology options developed in response to current economic and technical drivers. However, this ignores opportunities to deliver long-term efficiency gains from yet to be discovered options. In response, this paper aims to calculate the absolute potential for reducing energy demand by improving efficiency, by finding the efficiency limits for individual conversion devices and overlaying these onto the global network of energy flow. The potential efficiency gains for each conversion device are found by contrasting current energy demand with theoretical minimum energy requirements. Further insight is gained by categorising conversion losses according to the underlying loss mechanisms. The result estimates the overall efficiency of global energy conversion to be only 11 per cent; global demand for energy could be reduced by almost 90 per cent if all energy conversion devices were operated at their theoretical maximum efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Legitimacy theory has become one of the most cited theories within the social and environmental accounting area. Yet there remains deep scepticism amongst many researchers that it offers any real insight into the voluntary disclosures of corporations. This brief paper outlines responses to two specific concerns identified in the literature. It will eventually form part of a much larger project addressing a range of issues associated with legitimacy theory. First, the paper brings some of the more recent developments in the management and ethical literature on legitimacy and corporations to the accounting table. Second, there are contributions to the theory that have already been made by accounting researchers that are yet to be fully recognised. The author believes that legitimacy theory does offer a powerful mechanism for understanding voluntary social and environmental disclosures made by corporations, and that this understanding would provide a vehicle for engaging in critical public debate. The problem for legitimacy theory in contributing to our understanding of accounting disclosure specifically, and as a theory in general, is that the term has on occasion been used fairly loosely. This is not a problem of the theory itself, and the observation could be equally applied to a range of theories in a range of disciplines (see for example Caudill (1997) on the abuse of Evolutionary Theory). Failure to adequately specify the theory has been identified by Suchman (1995, p. 572, emphasis in original), who observed that “Many researchers employ the term legitimacy, but few define it”. Hybels (1995, p. 241) comments that “As the tradesmen [sic] of social science have groped to build elaborate theoretical structures with which to shelter their careers and disciplines, legitimation has been a blind man's hammer.” This paper begins to address these issues.

abstract = {This article aims to develop an alternative framework for analyzing public decision making processes. It uses a complex systems approach that revolves around the coevolutionary principle of reciprocal selection between policy systems and their environment. The framework is applied to two case studies about port extensions in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands in order to explain the outcomes of decisions that were unintended, unobserved, unexpected, and unwanted. It is argued that this approach helps detecting the causal relationships between decision making and the consequences for the system being governed and how this causality that is often badly understood can backfire on public decision makers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
annote = {Reciprocal selection therefore means that
the future state of systems is mutually determined by
selection pressures from the decision makers and the
systems they want to govern.


the consequences of a particular action may appear to be
detached from that action because of the complex
causation.


The introduction of new actors help cope with system complexity and it pushes towards semplicity


reductionism is inevitable as it is impossible to fully determine the state of unlimited complex systems (Richardson, 2007)




Actors usually preserve information that is at that moment regarded as vital and discard the rest, so we may encounter issues related to valuable information that was discarded initially may not be there when actually needed at a later time


The different states of a system can be defined as attractors, being attractors stable and resilient against perturbations it does not always change under exerted pressure
If a system moves between a limited set of
attractors this is called the torus attractor (cf. Otter, 2000)


the policy system applies information selection mechanism 
The cycle of reciprocal selection is not considered to be a sequential
process but a simultaneous process that consists of continuous feedback loops between the systems.


decision making doesnt happen through fixed sequential stages but it has conscutive longitudinal character},

abstract = {By 1958, a model of human behavior capable of serving as the microlevel foundation for organizational and policy studies was in place. The scientific soundness of that model is unquestioned, yet fundamentals of that behavioral model of choice have not yet benn incorporated into political science. Much analysis relies on models of rational maximization despite the availability of a more scientifically sound behavioral base. In this article I examine the reasons for and ramifications of this neglect of sound science in political science, focusing primarily on public policy and public administration. While neither approach can lay claim to major successes in preduction, the behavioral model of choice predicts distributions of organizational and policy outputs in a superior fashion.},

abstract = {“The most crucial aspect of Silicon Valley is its networks.” There is no proposition so universally agreed upon and so little studied. We see two main reasons for this. The first is that the analysis of social networks has been mainly the province of sociologists, but only in recent years have they become interested in industrial organization. The second is that methods for systematic study of social networks are of very recent origin.1 Sociologists' earlier theoretical concerns led them to focus network analysis on small groups (like children in schools). But more recent work has treated larger groups and even entire industries (see, e.g., Granovetter and McGuire 1998). In this chapter we outline a project in progress, “Networks of Silicon Valley.” Ultimately, we hope to achieve a systematic mapping of the Valley's networks and their evolution over time.},

abstract = {For more than a decade, firms, governmental organizations, knowledge institutes and other relevant actors in the Sloe Area and Canal Zone have been engaged in multiple initiatives dedicated to the sustainable industrial development of their region. In this article, a reconstruction is made of these developments, using Event Sequence Analysis (ESA), to study how actors built and maintained the collaborations that drive these initiatives, and to study the extent to which these initiatives mutually influence each other. The analysis reveals that there are no direct mutual influences between the developments, but that there are indirect influences based on partially overlapping sources of institutional capacity (i.e. the capacity for collective action). Based on the results, several additions are made to existing models of industrial symbiosis that describe the stages through which industrial symbiosis develops. The first addition is the idea that industrial symbiosis can be understood to build on stable intermediate components that develop autonomously from each other. The second addition is that the development of industrial symbiosis itself can be understood as a stable intermediate for more comprehensive developments at a higher system level. The third addition is that the development of industrial symbiosis can be understood to be embedded in a larger social context that influences the opportunities that actors see for collective action towards industrial symbiosis.},

It draws insights from institutional theory, corporate social performance perspective, and stakeholder theory and relates them to internal processes. Beyond-compliance policies are adopted, if at all, due to two types of intra-firm process: power based and leadership based. These processes arise under different conditions and lead to different types of outcome.},

While institutional pressures and market demand often motivate firms to adopt an EMS, the reasons why they certify for ISO 14001 are less clear. In this study, we interviewed members of the Canadian pulp and paper industry who had either an EMS or ISO 14001 certification to understand why they may have become ISO 14001 certified. We found that task visibility and environmental impact opacity lead to differences in a firm's approach to ISO 14001 certification in the absence of coercive pressures.

-Once disparate organizations in the same line of business are structured into an actual field (as we shall argue, by competition, thestate, or the professions), powerful forces emerge that lead them to become more similar to one another.
New practices may be put in place but the overal decision process organizational structure will be quite similar to competing firms'


As innovation spreads, a threshold is reached beyond which adoption provides legitimacy rather than improves performance (Meyer and Rowan, 1997) =={\textgreater} this constitutes a loss of rationality in the adoption of the organizational structure, as one structure is probably thought out for efficiency for one specific organization and the same may not apply to other companies in the same field.

@article{Andersson2008,
abstract = {This article seeks to shed new light on the study of decentralized natural resource governance by applying institutional theories of polycentricity—the relationships among multiple authorities with overlapping jurisdictions. The emphasis on multi-level dynamics has not penetrated empirical studies of environmental policy reforms in non-industrial countries. On the contrary, many of today's decentralization proponents seem to be infatuated with the local sphere, expecting that local actors are always able and willing to govern their natural resources effectively. Existing studies in this area often focus exclusively on characteristics and performance of local institutions. While we certainly do not deny the importance of local institutions, we argue that institutional arrangements operating at other governance scales—such as national government agencies, international organizations, NGOs at multiple scales, and private associations—also often have critical roles to play in natural resource governance regimes, including self-organized regimes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
annote = {Theories of policentricity































Alla governance institutions are imperfect responses to the challenge of collective-action problems.
















Hence, the effective management of these resources remains one of the most difficult tasks facing modern public policy (Dietz et al. 2003) Dietz, T., Ostrom, E., {\&} Stern, P. (2003). The struggle to govern the commons. Science, 302, 1907–1912































Decentralized governments can have the following characteristics:















- better understanding of common-pool resources
- can self organize and develop effective governance mechanisms, it is however not the the norm
- strictly horizontally organized governance systems have limited capabilities
- because of local knowledge, local users are more likely to create rules that better suit common pool resource (tang 1992, 1994)
- probable better understanding of who is trustworthy and who isn't 
- they may create limitations that are effective in discriminating against who is not trustworthy
- decentralization can become very or prohibitively costly to some local users
- in decentralized sytems you also risk stagnation, this is due to unexpected outcomes from innovating policies on local ecological system.. the probable lack of scientific knowledge is as well as contributing factor
- another challenge of decentralized governemtns is how do you define rules dedicated to the incentivation of local actors towards supporting proper local resource management etc















































Policentric governance















Policentric analytical approach studies the conditions for developing adaptive systems where each has some degree of autonomy to cope with one set of discrete policy arenas
Institutional Attributes































ON LOCAL ACTORS PARTICIPATION AND SELF ORGANIZATION















-governance agreements are more effective when coming from public self-organization
-each unit exercises considerable indepen- dence to make and enforce rules within a circumscribed scope of authority for a specified geographical area.
- some of this units are dedicated to general purposes while others may be highly specialized
-inclusive decision making in decentralized local economies increases the quality of public services, improves responsive- ness and accountability of local government and even enhances equitable access to services and productive asset
















It is fundamental for decentralized natural resource governance that local governments posses sufficient internal institutional capacity 















































external note not related to this paper
It is the lack of institutional capacity in italian decentralized govenerments that may cause failure of the decentralization of fiscal powers 































- Local governance executives (mayors) are more likely to support and invest in municipal natural resource governance when they perceive clear institutional incentives to do so, regardless of the degree of decentralization.
















-The effect of upward political pressure on local politicians to invest in natural resource governance activities will be stronger in more decentralized rgimes than in less decentralized regimes.},

Resource based view







articulates the relationships among firm resources, capabilities, and competitive advantages.








preemptive commitments enable firms to gain control of specific markets and resouces.
Finally. Hamel and Pra-halad (1989. 1994)have emphasized the importance of "competing for the future" as a neglected dimension of competitive advantage.








the firm must be concerned with both profitability in the present, future growth but also "future sources and position" (explicit strategy)

The resource-based view takes this thinking one step further: It posits that competitive advantage can be sustained only if the capabilities creating the advantage are supported by resources that are not easily duplicated by competitors.},
