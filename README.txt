Using the template
------------------

This is the Leiden University CML LaTeX template for reports and theses. 
It is a variation of the TU Delft LaTex template designed to work with all 
versions of LaTeX.


Installation on Windows
-----------------------

The Leiden University CML LaTeX template has been tested to work with the most recent version
of MiKTeX at the time of this writing (2.9). The following packages are required
on top of a basic MiKTeX installation to make full use of the template:

  caption, fancyhdr, filehook, footmisc, fourier, l3kernel, l3packages,
  metalogo, mptopdf, ms, natbib, pgf, realscripts, tipa, titlesec, tocbibind,
  unicode-math, url, xcolor, xetex-def

Note that MiKTeX will generally automatically install these packages if they are
missing from your installation.



Installation on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
-------------------------------------

Recent versions of Debian, and derived distributions such as Ubuntu, use the TeX
Live system. Install the following packages to make full use of the this
template:

  texlive, texlive-fonts-extra, texlive-math-extra, texlive-lang-dutch,
  texlive-lang-english, texlive-latex-extra, texlive-xetex
